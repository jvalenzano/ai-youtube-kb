## 🔍 Observations (Before)

### Potential Issues to Address
1. **Slide 1** (`0m00s_00000000.png`): Very small (2.7KB) - likely black/empty frame
2. **Slide 14** (`37m16s_c03fc03f.png`): Copyright/trademark slide (44KB) - may be filtered as filler text
3. **Duplicate**: Slide 10 is duplicate of slide 6 (same hash `81d0be5ea3c18b5e`)
4. **Low OCR**: Slides 1, 2 have no OCR text
5. **Partial OCR**: Slides 3, 11 have partial OCR (may be filtered)

### Human-in-the-Loop Visual Observation (Pre-Script)

**Pattern Observed**: Early slides (intro) and final slides (closing/ads) are typically not valuable content.

**SLIDES TO KEEP** (7 slides - content slides only):
- ✅ `slide_5m12s_f1c0eeb6.png` (5m12s) - Research survey overview
- ✅ `slide_7m14s_a552b5ca.png` (7m14s) - Key Takeaways
- ✅ `slide_11m04s_81d0be5e.png` (11m04s) - Aspiration/Strategy/Execution
- ✅ `slide_15m20s_b091ad68.png` (15m20s) - Survey question/results
- ✅ `slide_19m04s_b4b5cb4a.png` (19m04s) - Digital co-workers activities
- ✅ `slide_27m10s_b0e9bf85.png` (27m10s) - Execution gap analysis
- ✅ `slide_31m46s_81d0be5e.png` (31m46s) - Duplicate of #6 (but keeping for now)

**SLIDES TO REMOVE** (7 slides - intro/closing):
- ❌ `slide_0m00s_00000000.png` (0m00s) - Empty/black frame
- ❌ `slide_0m02s_c75b3801.png` (0m02s) - Intro slide
- ❌ `slide_0m04s_eea630b8.png` (0m04s) - Intro slide with logo
- ❌ `slide_33m30s_91b91e6c.png` (33m30s) - Contact/attribution slide
- ❌ `slide_33m32s_9172d8c9.png` (33m32s) - Contact info slide
- ❌ `slide_37m00s_e0341f87.png` (37m00s) - End slide (theCUBE website)
- ❌ `slide_37m16s_c03fc03f.png` (37m16s) - Copyright/trademark slide

**Expected Final Count**: 7 slides (6 unique + 1 duplicate to review)

### Expected Actions During Test
1. ✅ Add credit overlay to all slides
2. ✅ Review flagged slides (blurry, duplicates, filler text)
3. ✅ Manual curation (delete unwanted slides) - **7 slides to remove**
4. ✅ Final sync and metadata update

---

## 📝 AFTER STATE (Final Results)

### Changes Made
- [x] Credit overlay added (with old system - needs re-adding with interactive prompt)
- [x] Duplicate credits fixed (removed ~90px duplicate bars from all 7 slides)
- [x] Slides reviewed and curated
- [x] Slides removed: **3 slides** (intro + 2 contact slides)
- [x] Slides kept: **7 slides** (all content slides)
- [x] Metadata updated and synced

### Final Statistics
- **Total Slides (After)**: 7
- **Unique Slides (After)**: 7
- **Removed**: 3 (slide_0m04s, slide_33m30s, slide_33m32s)
- **Credit Overlay Applied**: Yes (old system - needs re-adding with new interactive prompt)
- **Duplicate Credits Fixed**: Yes (7 slides fixed)

### Final Slide List (After Curation)

| # | Filename | Timestamp | Status | Notes |
|---|----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `slide_5m12s_f1c0eeb6.png` | 5m12s | ✅ Kept | Research survey overview |
| 2 | `slide_7m14s_a552b5ca.png` | 7m14s | ✅ Kept | Key Takeaways |
| 3 | `slide_11m04s_81d0be5e.png` | 11m04s | ✅ Kept | Aspiration/Strategy/Execution |
| 4 | `slide_15m20s_b091ad68.png` | 15m20s | ✅ Kept | Survey question/results |
| 5 | `slide_19m04s_b4b5cb4a.png` | 19m04s | ✅ Kept | Digital co-workers activities |
| 6 | `slide_27m10s_b0e9bf85.png` | 27m10s | ✅ Kept | Execution gap analysis |
| 7 | `slide_31m46s_81d0be5e.png` | 31m46s | ✅ Kept | Duplicate of #3 (kept for context) |

### Removed Slides

| Filename | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| `slide_0m04s_eea630b8.png` | Intro slide with duplicate citation |
| `slide_33m30s_91b91e6c.png` | Contact/attribution slide |
| `slide_33m32s_9172d8c9.png` | Contact info slide |

### Technical Details
- **Image Dimensions**: All slides reduced from ~793px to ~703px height (removed duplicate credit bars)
- **Metadata Sync**: ✅ Completed (3 entries removed)
- **Human Reviewed**: ✅ Yes
- **Credit Overlay**: Needs to be re-added using new interactive prompt system

### Notes
- ✅ Successfully removed 3 unwanted slides (intro + contact slides)
- ✅ Fixed duplicate credit bars on all 7 remaining slides
- ✅ Metadata synced correctly
- ⚠️ Credit overlay was added with old system - should be re-added with new interactive prompt to ensure correct attribution text

**Status**: ✅ Completed (pending credit overlay re-add with interactive prompt)

## 📚 LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. **Credit Overlay System**
- **Issue**: Hardcoded defaults ("Scott Hebner • The Next Frontiers of AI") were applied without user input
- **Solution**: Implemented interactive prompting system that asks user for exact credit text
- **Key Learning**: Human should control attribution text - no assumptions or auto-generation
- **Action**: Both `extract_slides.py` and `add_credit_overlay.py` now prompt interactively

### 2. **Duplicate Credit Detection**
- **Issue**: Running credit overlay script twice created duplicate credit bars (~150px total instead of ~60px)
- **Solution**: Created `fix_duplicate_credits.py` script that detects and removes duplicate credit bars
- **Key Learning**: Need safeguards against duplicate operations, or better: detect existing credits before adding
- **Detection Method**: Analyze bottom 150px for dark regions > 80px (indicates duplicate)

### 3. **Image Display in Terminal**
- **Issue**: Image display wasn't working (stdout/stderr redirected to DEVNULL)
- **Solution**: Removed output redirection, added `--blocks` flag to viu, added flush calls
- **Key Learning**: Terminal image viewers need direct stdout access - don't capture their output
- **Fallback Chain**: viu → chafa → imgcat → ASCII art → external viewer

### 4. **Review Workflow**
- **Issue**: Only flagged slides were reviewed, not all slides
- **Solution**: Added `--review-all` flag to review every slide manually
- **Key Learning**: Sometimes human wants to review ALL slides, not just algorithm-flagged ones
- **Workflow**: Default = review flagged only, `--review-all` = review everything

### 5. **Metadata Synchronization**
- **Issue**: After manual deletion, metadata wasn't updated
- **Solution**: Use `sync_slide_metadata.py` after manual curation
- **Key Learning**: Always sync metadata after manual file operations
- **Best Practice**: Run sync after any manual slide deletion/curation

### 6. **Slide Curation Patterns**
- **Pattern Observed**: Intro slides (0m00s-0m04s) and closing slides (contact/copyright) are typically not valuable
- **Content Slides**: Usually start around 5m+ and end before contact slides
- **Key Learning**: Human curation is essential - algorithms can't judge content value
- **Recommendation**: Always review slides manually, especially intro/closing sections

### 7. **Interactive Prompts**
- **Best Practice**: Show examples, preview, and confirm before applying changes
- **User Experience**: Rich panels with examples help users understand what's expected
- **Key Learning**: Interactive prompts > CLI args > hardcoded defaults

### 8. **File Size Changes**
- **Observation**: Duplicate credits increased file sizes significantly
- **Before Fix**: ~793px height (with duplicates)
- **After Fix**: ~703px height (single credit bar)
- **Key Learning**: Monitor file sizes as indicator of issues (duplicates, corruption, etc.)
