### 5. 14. Agentic AI – What’s Hype, Myth, and Truth
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euTRqoB_OlA
**Duration:** 46:52

**Summary:**
- Agentic AI represents a shift from individual productivity tools to intelligent systems that can reason, collaborate with humans, and operate autonomously in complex workflows
- Unlike general-purpose LLMs, effective AI systems are domain-specific ensembles of models, agents, and modules working together rather than single algorithms
- Trust and explainability are critical barriers to enterprise adoption - systems must be able to trace reasoning paths and explain decisions for governance and compliance

**Key Takeaways:**
- **DO:** Focus on domain-specific, systems-based approaches rather than general-purpose single models
- **DO:** Prioritize explainable AI systems that can trace reasoning paths for governance and trust
