**Video ID:** 5YrnYJBOpZY
**Channel:** SiliconANGLE theCUBE
**Duration:** 37:18
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrnYJBOpZY

**Module:** Foundations of AI Agents
**Module Rationale:** This video establishes fundamental concepts about digital labor transformation, distinguishes between different AI strategies, and provides foundational research insights rather than specific workflows or tools

## Summary
- TheCUBE Research launched a Digital Labor Transformation Index survey with 625 respondents across 13 dimensions, revealing a maturity score of 3.1 out of 5
- 71% of leaders believe they will be the last generation to manage a human-only workforce, indicating digital labor transformation is inevitable
- There's a clear maturity decline from aspiration (4.1) to strategy (3.1) to execution (1.8), highlighting significant implementation gaps
- Digital coworkers are evolving beyond automating repetitive tasks into knowledge work involving planning, problem-solving, decision-making, and autonomous action
- HR is emerging as a key co-architect of digital labor strategy, with ~40% of Chief AI Officers expecting their roles to evolve into digital HR leadership
- Trust is identified as the defining challenge for digital labor adoption, encompassing security, compliance, governance, and user trust dimensions
- An agentic AI strategy is fundamentally different from a digital labor transformation strategy - both are required but serve different purposes
- Implementation is heavily dominated by IT and AppDev teams (technical focus) rather than cross-organizational collaboration needed for success
- Current AI limitations include being based on statistical probabilities rather than true decision-making capabilities with causal understanding

## Key Takeaways
- **DO:** Develop separate but coordinated strategies for agentic AI technology and digital labor transformation
- **DO:** Establish cross-organizational teams involving HR, business units, and technical teams for digital labor implementation
- **DO:** Focus on trust-building across multiple dimensions including security, compliance, governance, and user acceptance
- **DON'T:** Don't make business-critical decisions based solely on generative AI outputs without human judgment
- **DON'T:** Don't treat digital labor transformation as purely a technical IT implementation - it requires business and workforce strategy integration

## Topics
digital labor transformation, agentic AI strategy, workforce evolution, AI maturity assessment, cross-organizational collaboration, trust and governance, knowledge work automation

## Key Moments
- [01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrnYJBOpZY&t=62s): Key finding that 70% of leaders believe they'll be last to manage human-only workforce

- [19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrnYJBOpZY&t=1177s): Evolution from automation to knowledge work including decision-making and problem-solving capabilities
- [27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrnYJBOpZY&t=1667s): Implementation gap showing only 16% have cross-business teams despite strategic need for collaboration
- [31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YrnYJBOpZY&t=1915s): Distinction between agentic AI strategy and workforce strategy requiring different stakeholders

## TL;DR
Digital labor transformation requires distinct strategy from agentic AI, with major execution gaps despite high aspirations.

>> Hello and welcome back to the
Next Frontiers of AI Podcast where we explore the real world strategies and success stories that
are shaping the future of enterprise AI.
I'm your host, Scott
Hebner, principal analyst for AI at theCUBE Research.
Thanks so much for tuning in.
As we have discussed
throughout this podcast series, we're now entering the
golden age of AI agents, the beginning of a new
super cycle of innovation.
And while technology innovation
is moving at warp speed, the real impact will
be in the labor markets where the very definition of a workforce is being
totally re-imagined.
The nature of work will change forever and likely in a more profound manner than past transformations.
That's why I'm so excited to share hot off the press
findings from a new digital labor transformation index survey sponsored by theCUBE Research launching
this month in September 2025.
And the data is striking.
More than 70% of leaders believe they
will be the last generation

[01:02]
to manage a human-only workforce.
Yet our maturity score
across 13 dimensions is 3.
1 out of 5 showing progress, but there's a clear decline
in maturity from aspiration to strategy to execution.
And this brings me back to one of the principle tenets
I applied while at IBM, a strategy without
execution is hallucination.
So it's clear that
there's much work to do.
We've paired this research
with dozens of conversations with leaders across our ecosystem, from Deloitte to Semaphore.
ai to Openstream and
HOAi just to name a few.
The findings are crystal clear,
we are entering a moment, unlike any before, which will fundamentally
reshape labor markets, redefine how value is created and unlock entirely new
models of productivity.
Why? We found that digital
coworkers are evolving fast, moving beyond automating repetitive tasks or executing predefined
workflows into the realm

[02:04]
of knowledge work where they
can plan, problem solve, make decisions, and even
act autonomously alongside human counterparts.
This is a truly a profound shift.
We also learned that today's
leaders differentiate the notion of an agentic AI
strategy from a digital labor transformation strategy.
Both are required but not
the same. So is that okay?
Will that change? Do they have to merge?
The index provides a treasure
trove of actionable insights to help answer these questions, and this is just one of five indices to come in the weeks ahead.
So with that today we're going to start by unpacking the current state of the digital labor transformation
market, why it matters, what leaders must do to prepare.
Joining me to break it
all down is my colleague and fellow principal analyst
here at theCUBE Research, Christophe Bertrand,
and let me bring him up.
Thanks so much for joining me again.
Chris, it is great to have you here.

[03:06]
>> Thank you for having me.
Great conversation topic.
>> Yeah, it's fascinating because it's becoming more of a business and cultural strategy than
I think many think right now versus just a technology strategy.
And I think that makes
it even more fascinating.
>> And the other thing is I do research in a very different area,
but related in many ways because I focus more on
resilience infrastructure, data protection, things like that.
And of course I've been
looking at the impact of AI on anything around data
and backup recovery.
And it turns out this is intertwined.
It's definitely changing the
way architectures will evolve, the way people interact
with the solutions, even at the infrastructure level.
So overall, I think it's
a fundamental conversation to be having right now.
>> Yeah, I agree. You got to have a north star
that you're heading for.
And to my surprise with the research data, which was 625 respondents,

[04:07]
is I think people were further
ahead in this thinking than I certainly anticipated.
You've been a leader here
at the theCUBE Research and getting us into the world of surveys and data-driven research.
I think you've done three of these or in the process by the time you're done with three of these.
And I think it's great
because it's adding data to our experiences and our insights.
It's going to make things much more interesting around here, isn't it?
And for our clients, more importantly, >> Right.
And just to point out for our audience, if you're not familiar
with market research, when you're talking about 625 respondents, you are definitely in a very,
very comfortable zone in terms of the meaning of it statistically.
Typically, anything around 300 is great.
So 600 is even better.
So you can pretty much
take it to the bank.
I think what you have, Scott, is with the index you've
devised is really a state of the market and not just one.
You have 13 of them you said.

[05:07]
>> So let me explain, actually,
let me bring up a chart here.
So the name of the research is called the
Agentic AI Futures Index, and think of it as five
indices or five modules.
What we're talking about
today is the digital labor transformation module, 625 respondents.
When I say 13 dimensions, I mean there were 13 different aspects of the digital labor market we looked at.
And what's going to follow in
the weeks ahead is an industry around agentic AI maturity more from a technology perspective.
As you know because we
collaborated on it, the Trust and Governance Index, which
is related to a summit you and I are looking to
run later in the year.
There's one on reasoning
and decision intelligence, and then there's one on
causal AI innovation.
So each of them are going to
have 625 respondents in total.
There's 61 questions.
We surveyed nine different
roles from executives

[06:07]
to practitioners and those that are actively
involved in either business or technical strategy, 13 industries.
And it was just held, so it's
fresh data English through US, the UK and Canada.
So it should give us a lot of
really interesting insights.
>> Yeah, absolutely. And I think the timing of it is critical.
I was just on a couple of briefings from AI type of companies,
hyperscalers, everybody's in AI and there's a lot of AI washing
out there, but the truth is it's very complex and I think a lot of people
asking themselves, "Well, what does this all mean for my own job?
" Whether you're in IT,
whether you're just working in any type of industry.
So I think it's a very
interesting time to see where the leaders are
with their implementations and how much is hype versus reality.
>> Yeah. Well let's jump into
some of the findings, right?
We'll give you a sneak peek

[07:07]
and obviously there's a
boatload of this stuff behind the scenes here, but let me bring up what I
consider to be the key takeaways.
First, let me start on the top right.
So the index is from one to five, and it's a set of criteria
that we've developed here that basically applies a methodology on where the aggregate
market sits in that index.
And what we found was 3.1, so
it's somewhere in the middle.
And what I'm going to show you
shortly is it's not like all the questions were in the same 3.
1 range. So there's different parts or different dimensions, if
you will, of this movement that have different levels of maturity.
So what do we find?
First of all, digital
labor is inevitable, right?
I mentioned in the intro that,
what was it, 70% are saying that they're going to be
the last set of leaders to manage a human-only workforce.
No doubt that it's inevitable.
Two is HR is emerging as a key

[08:10]
and primary co-architect of the strategy and the chief AI officers
that are being put in place, there's a pretty solid, it's
a minority, but around 40% or so that believe that
their roles are going to evolve into becoming
digital HR leaders.
So there'll be business,
there'll be technology, and there'll be HR all fused together.
I found that really interesting.
Trust is the defining challenge.
You know that Christophe, right?
No trust, no ROI, trust has
multiple dimensions itself.
Everything from security to
compliance and governance and just user trust and all that.
And that's becoming a big
challenge in this movement.
I also found the barriers
are multi-faceted and multi-organizational.
So there's a lot of barriers
that are trying to be tackled.
And as we'll talk about in
a second here, Christophe, the gap between aspiration to
strategy to execution is real.
So before I move on to that,
what are your thoughts on this?

[09:13]
>> Well, the one thing that gets
my attention is the presence of essentially the functional leads of the business folks in
this conversation, right?
Let's face it, if you're
talking about implementing a business process, of course you're going to have business people involved.
The question becomes do they
understand what's going on with the implementation?
Are there some dimensions that maybe we're missing in a process because you're dealing
with a non-technical crowd?
At the same time, it's
also maybe a guarantee that things will be done correctly because as a business professional
in your functional area, you're going to think
about multiple dimensions, and you mentioned trust,
which is of course even maybe more important
than anything else.
What data, what infrastructure and what controls are you using to get all of this done whether
you're talking about agents or just leveraging data
to make better decisions or automate some processes?
>> Yeah, that's true. And when
you look at the demographics of the survey, there are business users and there are business stakeholders.

[10:14]
So it's not just a technology gang.
And as you know, we can use cross tabs to take a look at each one of those.
In fact, one of the
things I found was those that have the most
experience in times of years and the most familiarity with agentic AI are the
most optimistic about digital labor and its capabilities and all that which I found interesting is that the more involved you are, the more of a believer you're becoming.
And we can segment that up obviously across
the different roles.
And one of the things
in the survey results that I also found is that
there's a big difference between do users trust this
stuff versus do the technology guys and gals trust this stuff?
And there's a lot to be kind
of weeded out in all this.
Let me bring up what I
consider to be the top line.
If I had to net out what
I think is the bottom line takeaway, if I'm an executive
thinking about a strategy, and you can see here the
aspiration, the maturity

[11:18]
of the aspiration, the rise
of digital labor if you will, is quite mature, 4.
1. But when you look at
those that are starting to define, and implement, and where they are in that
process of a strategy, and whether it's departmental, isolated or enterprise wide, you can see that the maturity drops to 3.
1. And then when you look at
actual execution in particular the barriers, the gaps in the culture, 1.
8. So what this is telling me, and I'd be curious to your
take on this, is that...
And this has happened in many
other transformations too, I think is the aspirations are
there, the vision is there, strategies are being put in
place, they're finding problems.
Those problems are real
in terms of inhibitors, and there's a lot to do to
get this all straightened out.
And the other thing that jumped out at me, which perhaps may be the headline here, is that an agentic AI strategy
is not the same thing

[12:18]
as a digital labor
transformation strategy.
And I think that's a super key
point to emphasize as we kind of unwind all this data
in the weeks ahead.
>> Yeah, I mean, I think
when you're looking at these indices, what you're
realizing very quickly is, and we'll go through some of the data and I know that you have
a lot more behind this, but the reality for
our viewers is this, is that these are all the signs of an early market in general terms, there's probably another index in there that you should throw in at
some point in further research, which would be complexity
of implementation, which I think is why you're seeing that 1.
8 because you have so many
tools, so many platforms.
If you again, listen to
vendors, they will say, "Oh, we have a unified way for you to do this, that and the other.
" And then you realize
they have 20 different product solutions, platforms, et cetera, and it becomes very complex.
But what's interesting is
that the aspiration is high.
So there is maybe this realization

[13:20]
that AI can be your friend,
not necessarily a foe, and can be an enabler.
I think there are other reports
out there from other firms that have hinted at the fact
that there is very little ROI or it's hard to find ROI.
I think that's not necessarily
true if you narrow the scope to specific processes, but clearly the execution
is you are walking into a very new world, totally different world.
I mean even ourselves as
industry analysts, you can ask the question, "Should
we be doing this job?
Won't we be replaced by AI?
" And the truth is, well,
in the end, you still have to think through what
it is you want to do.
You still have to have some
humans driving the boat here to an extent, even if you
get some assistance just like flying a plane, a lot of stuff is automated, but still in the pilot.
And frankly, I think we are
probably okay for a while.
We still have pilots for many
years. That's my view anyway.
So I think the same thing applies here.
And as long as you don't
see execution in the four

[14:23]
or five-diameter range, I
think we can rest assured that humans will be controlled.
>> By the time that happens, I'll be tuna- fishing off the coast of Marco Island down there on the West Coast of Florida, hopefully.
But I can tell you just from
as I interpret the data, is I don't think that people are envisioning
the elimination of jobs.
I think they truly are looking at this as giving their employees and
their work as superpowers.
And it's not just productivity superpowers, it's
thinking, it's reasoning, it's just making better decisions, it's diagnosing root causes.
I think I was impressed by...
And there were multiple
questions hitting at what do you mean by digital labor?
And we're going to get into some of that.
So actually let's unpack some of this and get a little bit deeper into it.
Let's start with the aspiration.
This is an example of one
of the questions related to the concept

[15:24]
or the category that I consider
to be the aspirational view, the rise of digital labor.
And the bottom line
here, 71% of leaders say that this generation of business
leaders would be the last to manage a human only workforce.
So again, this is one
of several questions, but when you look 41% strongly agree, another 30% agree, and even another 21%, if you
add them in there, you're up around 90%.
That's a huge...
You've done a lot more surveys through your career
than I have, Christophe, but when you have 90% that are agreeing, that is pretty significant.
That's why I think the index,
maturity index, in terms of aspirational thinking and vision, 4.
1, that's pretty well down the road for a really early marketplace.
>> Yeah, I think that's
also the hype around AI, but the truth is it's
happening whether there's ROI, whether we like it or not, it's happening.
I think there will be
probably some mitigation to

[16:27]
that speed over time as
people realize, "Well, it's a lot more complex
and we are photo rich.
" And for some processes
I think it's super valid, extremely valuable.
Look, if I live in a Bay Area, and if you drive from the
airport to San Francisco, you're going to see a bunch of billboards and literally you have companies
there telling you, "Well, your new inside sales force
is essentially gigantic.
" You save X amount of money by using REI.
And I think it appeals to
the business side of things.
Yes, of course, who
would want to save money and add to the top line
and the bottom line?
I would love that. But the truth is, I think you're correct in that it gives or it de-multiplies the ability of the individual to do their job.
So there is an operational
efficiency dimension to it, and in reality there is so much that needs to happen in a lot of those companies.
There's just too much data to begin with.
So in many organizations,
it's so much to do that augmenting the ability
of the existing workforce

[17:29]
to do more with less is
actually a great thing because otherwise what happens is the human side that maybe we're not talking
about enough here, which is, well, you can't analyze enough, you can't do enough, you
can't perform enough.
Well, you end up burning people out.
You end up with
dissatisfaction, you end up with mistakes being made.
So as long as we understand
this as an addition to your capabilities as an
individual, I think that's great.
Now, again, the smart
individuals, the smart employees will make AI their friends.
I see the same thing in some
research out recently conducted around data protection and AI.
The expectation is that
vendors have to include more AI in their data
protection processes to help with automation, to help
IT journalists be able to better recover data.
So while you're taking a
very general approach here, which is very key because
that's across the board, in reality, it already is applying into
very intricate components of the IT infrastructure and
the economy in general terms.

[18:34]
>> Yeah, 100% right. I agree
with everything you said and where those aspiration people are going to break through because...
And I can tell you in the
data behind the aspiration, there is investment, actually more investment than I thought.
And that's where I kind
of concluded from a lot of what I saw was that it's
being viewed a little bit differently than the agentic
AI technology strategy.
It's a component of it, but it's much broader,
which makes it interesting.
So let's turn to strategy for a second.
Again, this is probably where
the most questions were.
So the survey has given some
really good insights into the strategic nature of what people
are trying to accomplish.
And one of the things that
jumped out at me is right here, which is this is a movement from software that helps people analyze and automate things, whether
it be making graphics or whether it be automating how you process a customer service call or diagnose an agent in
a network, for example,

[19:37]
to knowledge work, where it's more than
just making predictions and automating tasks.
It's to knowledge work,
which means make decisions, problem solve, diagnose
problems, pursue goals, and you can see what the questions on the right side here in terms of what they envision in their strategy.
Obviously automating routine and repetitive tasks is
still number one at 67%, but when you take two, three,
and four, which are all 60 or around 60 or above, or let's say an average
around 60%, diagnose and solve problems, assist
in making better decisions, pursue goals with minimal guidance, and then there's ultimately
50%, half envision that these things are going to go off and do autonomous work
on behalf of workers.
That's a hell of a lot
more of a knowledge work- based thought process than what has traditionally been associated with SaaS applications.

[20:37]
And where the software market has been, which has been about automation.
If there's a single word, it's automation and maybe analytics of data, right?
>> But what's interesting
is there seems to be a bit of a decision piece of it,
and we'll talk about that because you want to make sure
the decision that may be made by a digital co-worker, an
agent is actually correct.
But, look, I was just
on a briefing literally less than an hour ago.
I'm not going to say
who because I'm not here to talk about the specific vendor.
But what was interesting
is that we're showing how their solution can allow you to better migrate data from
one environment to another and with essentially
some sort of templatized automation that is AI driven, you can ask natural language
questions, "Hey, I'm trying to do this and trying to do
that, what would you recommend?
"
And it gives you those sort of guidelines or guide posts within which
you can then maybe customize.
Well, that's great because
instead of me having to do hours of analysis and this and that and the other, I can go
ask the question, "Okay,

[21:38]
I've got the data analysis, the analysis intelligently
performed," is there and I can go make a decision
and say, "Oh, by the way, go automate that for me.
" I'm going to trust that you
can go pop up this environment and create all the configurations.
Now I'm giving a very
specific IT environment, sort of infrastructure-ish example.
Same thing could apply to a CRM customer relationship management
or sales related process or marketing process.
Okay, go create a campaign
that will pick these leads or these type of profiles
and do this and do that and send them this type of information.
Now that I know these are the
people I should be talking to, give me any industry, any
example, as long as I know enough, I can probably give you
the same general idea of what it would look like.
What does that do for me
as the knowledge worker, the IT admin, the HR person, the marketing, the manager, the person?
Well, it gives me the
ability to be more efficient for the business, to
come from a place of data because it's been analyzed for me

[22:40]
and to do a lot more in the
amount of time that I have and also get, which we haven't talked about all the reporting.
I need to demonstrate the
value that the function, the business that I bring
back to the business.
So I think this is a very, one of the most important maybe
data points you've brought to the table and the levels of response are really, really high.
So I think there is no question that people have these expectations.
Now, where I'm going to say and put a big grain of
salt in all of this is, "But are we sure that
we can trust this data?
Can I trust that what
you're recommending I do, digital worker agent is
really what I should do?
" I can go talk to Scott
and the coffee machine and ask for your opinion
about this and that and you'll tell me,
"Well, I know enough that, yeah, I think you should be doing that.
" Or here, this is some agent telling me, "I think you should be doing that.
" Where do we stop or
begin with trust here?

[23:42]
>> And it's not only you
have to get your data right, because the bloodline of AI,
it's one of the core tenants of the summit we're going to
run later in the late fall, but it's also the AI algorithms.
And the bottom line is
today's AI is only as good as you want your future
to be just like your past.
And it is not designed
to help make decisions.
That's just the bottom line.
Decisions are based judgments, right?
And judgments are what are
used to actually be able to understand and solve problems.
Knowledge work is about judgments.
Generative AI, today's LLMs are about statistical probabilities,
correlations, patterns, and that's why there's
so much hallucination and challenges is do not make decisions, business critical decisions
based on generative AI outputs.
Now you get information and you can argue that information
can help you make better decisions, but it's not actually
helping you collaborating

[24:42]
with you to make a decision that understands the consequences
of different decisions.
And that's why the final survey I'm doing or the final index is on the notion of decision intelligence
reasoning and causal AI.
Because if you don't understand cause and effect of alternate
decisions, so you're right, the trust issue has a long way
to go and we'll unpack that.
The other thing before we move to the next and final piece of data here is, as we heard this morning
from our boss, Dave Vellante and our colleague George
Gilbert, they have this notion of earning software as a service
into service as software.
And I think that's a technical
architecture kind of thought.
That is this idea of
moving from automation of things into the world of knowledge work where you have these different services to do things better versus
it's all about the service and the service to knowledge
workers needs to be knowledge workers by
definition make judgments.

[25:44]
So I think there's a
technical thing going on here and then there's a business
thing going on here.
And the question is, do they merge?
>> Yeah, that's the big open question.
And for me, there are lots
of gaps just in the baseline.
Even what you're showing assumes
that the data is correct, that the agents are
managed, that to your point, the analysis can be trusted
or at least the information provided can be trusted
for further decision.
If you offload some of
that decision to an agent or some of that automation,
then can you trust the results?
So there are lots and
security of the whole thing.
So I think there are lots of...
It certainly stages, lots of gaps still.
But I do like the approach,
I like the approach of this notion that it's services
we provide to the business with this infrastructure versus consuming essentially what is today very piecemeal from multiple applications,
whether they're in a cloud

[26:46]
or on-prem or whatever they
are to try to get the job done.
Still some way to go on that.
>> Yeah, a big difference between downloading a software package to do my taxes versus
just telling an agent, "Do my taxes," right?
Let's deep dive on the gaps.
And this is again, one of several, actually more than several data points that we have in terms of questions.
But I chose this one because if you look at the strategy, it's cross organizational, it is HR working with a chief AI
officer, being a coordinator.
You got the data science teams,
you got the technical teams, you got the users, you
got the business units.
Very clear to me that's
what the strategy is about.
But when it comes to
actual implementation, the organizations that are part

[27:47]
of the implementation
stream, only 16% have cross- business teams responsible for
digital labor implementation and is dominated by IT and app dev.
And when you get down to
a shared model, cross- functional center of excellence or a board or even CXO leadership, like to see AIO chief AI officer or line of business including HR, I mean, look what happens here.
It's in the single digit and that's why the
maturity score is so low.
So we've gone from 4.1 on aspiration to 3.
1 on strategy to 1.
8 on execution and gaps.
And, Christophe, as you
know, this doesn't even get to the next level, this
chart right here at least of things like trust, which I asked a lot of questions about, and there security and there's all the other
things that we've been talking about for some time here.
So there's a lot. That's
my point in the intro.
There's a lot to do here, right?
Strategy without execution
is hallucination,

[28:48]
and there's a lot of
execution gaps and barriers and inhibitors that many don't know about yet, but they're going to come.
And there's a lot that
people do know about that they're struggling
to find answers for.
So a lot of innovation
still needs to come.
>> And I think your index
clearly shows, first of all, the research clearly shows
that the illness is on IT.
And to a certain extent,
the data science folks, which actually surprising, I would've expected data science to be...
Because I think it was pick one, right?
In this question you had
to add up to 100%, right?
If I'm not mistaken. So it's
not like pick all that apply.
It's like pick the one who's
really in charge of execution.
And essentially the folks you surveyed, they said...
Your respondents said, "Well, it's IT infrastructure." >> They didn't select cross- organizational. They
could have selected that.
>> Right. And your index, of
course is slanted towards collaboration, cross-organization
is the way to get to this nirvana of execution,

[29:50]
which I think is the right
assumption, by the way.
So the point is, without revealing too
much about the algorithm, that's really where we want things to be.
So I think two things.
Number one, you chose the
market is in early stages. Why?
Because right now it's
still considered a technical implementation, which
of course makes sense.
You need the infrastructure, but it's not an infrastructure play.
This is actually, you're
right, a business investment or a business play.
And the fact that it is a
business play means that you have to have cross-collaboration or cross-organization collaboration, and it's definitely lacking.
So this is where things can
head to the wall very quickly because there's only so much
you can ask IT to do for you.
Yeah, they're going to give
you the compute, they're going to give you the cloud
resources, they're going to give you whatever, the networking, hopefully they give you
compliance governance at a data level, which also would actually normally include other functions.
The fact that only 20% said data scientists or AI is a bit concerning

[30:51]
because I would've hoped
you'd have at least maybe 30.
30 and then... But no,
no, you don't have that.
So I think you're saying a market or initiative that are
in their infancy here.
Yes, IT is key. I think we're
just building the engine.
We're still putting foundations
in place, if you want to use a house analogy,
we haven't been thinking through all of the components.
Some people may have
at the strategy level, but we're not there yet.
So it looks like we're years and years before where we want to be.
If you run this in two
years and three years and you stop looking at the evolution, I hope we see the CXO number,
which I think you have at 5%.
Looking at the data here, you
want to see that in the 25, 30, 40, 50% range. We're not there yet.
>> Yeah, no leader, no output in, just to circle back real quickly here, and this is why this is one of many of the data points that...
Let me just conclude that
an agentic AI strategy

[31:55]
is not the same thing
as a workforce strategy, and there's different people involved.
So when you see a response, we just saw that it's overly dominated
by technical people in IT and AppDev, that tells me that it's just very different
than the business strategy around your workforce, which
is in most organizations, over 60% of your revenue where technical is like 5
or 6 or maybe 10 at most.
So this is where the impact's going to be, is bringing this stuff back to back to a fusion of technical
business and workforce.
And there was a lot of questions
that were asked about HR, which was also very revealing.
So before we wrap up here,
unfortunately we're running out of time here, any last thoughts on this and advice for people?
>> Well, so a couple of things.
First of all, I think I
would say, where can I get, if I'm a viewer, where can I get my hands on all of this data?
Because this is fascinating. We're just...

[32:56]
Obviously you're just
throwing, just discussing some of the top line levels.
You have another four indices.
You've devised across 13 industries.
How do I know what's going in my industry?
How do I get in touch
to get access to this?
And if I'm a vendor, more importantly, where does my solution fit in this model?
Because obviously
everybody's touting their AI, sometimes AI-washed solution,
going to be candid here, not everybody has what it
takes, so where do they fit?
So I think there's a vendor conversation, there's an end user conversation.
How do we gain access to this data?
>> Yeah. Well, thanks for setting that up because actually put a
chart in here for that, which is please do
contact me or Christophe or anyone here at theCUBE
Research if you'd like to explore the data in more detail or get some of the additional insights.
There really is a treasure trove, and again, this is the
first one out a five.
So we'll be moving on to
agentic AI, technology maturity, trust in governance, decision
intelligence and reasoning, and then the innovation around causal AI.

[33:59]
But either reach out to me on LinkedIn or my email, scott@siliconangle.
com, and we can definitely
talk about more about what we're finding here with all this data and a very, very interesting set of things were uncovered.
No doubt about it, as you saw, Christophe.
>> Absolutely. And a lot of my findings that I'll be sharing very
soon on data protection and AI really sort of take
this maybe to a more down to a more implementation
level type of dimension with processes such as
compliance, governance, data management, data
protection, data recovery.
But you are going to see very
similar trends in expectations and maturity, et cetera.
So I think there's definitely
something going on here.
We look at it from theCUBE
Research, from multiple angles, from multiple perspectives, and I think we're starting to
see a very interesting market shaping up and lots of
challenges for end users, but also I believe a lot of opportunity

[35:01]
and challenges for the
vendors working with those end users to get things
done with very high level of expectations, aspirations.
This is very transformative, and I think the next few
years will be a very key in establishing some of the best practices that are starting to emerge.
And I think I'd love to see how the indices evolve over time.
So I hope that maybe next year
we have the same conversation and look at how the dials
have moved if they have moved.
>> Yep. Yeah, no, I think we're swimming in insights and data here.
I mean, you mentioned
the surveys you're doing, Rob Stretchy has the
data platforms research that's underway, and Bob's doing the...
Ruteh is doing the AI infrastructure.
So kind of pull all this stuff together.
You have these different
dimensions, as you say, and very, very, very interesting.
All right, Christophe, thank
you for joining me today.
You've not only been a great colleague, but you've also been a real mentor,

[36:02]
and I really appreciate
everything that you've been doing and your thoughtful insights here and being a part of all this.
Your perspectives are great.
For our listeners, the
key takeaway is this, digital labor is no longer theoretical.
It truly is unfolding right now, and the leaders that lean
in will gain the resilience, the competitiveness, and a
true workforce advantage.
If you'd like to survey, as
I said before in more detail and explore with me, just get in touch and we can definitely
have those conversations.
