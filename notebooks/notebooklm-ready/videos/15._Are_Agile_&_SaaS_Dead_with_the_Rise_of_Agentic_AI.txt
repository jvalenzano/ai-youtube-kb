**Video ID:** AaGtyE1bIjY
**Channel:** SiliconANGLE theCUBE
**Duration:** 47:28

**Module:** Agentic Workflows & Orchestration
**Module Rationale:** The video primarily focuses on how agentic workflows are transforming software development processes, replacing Agile methodologies with lean engineering approaches that utilize parallel agent execution across different application layers.

## Summary
- Agentic AI is fundamentally changing software development from traditional Agile methodologies to 'lean software engineering' with significantly faster delivery times and reduced costs
- Companies are moving from 24-month development cycles to 10-month cycles using agentic workflows that work in parallel across all application layers
- Traditional SaaS models are being challenged as custom software development becomes faster and more cost-effective with AI agents, giving companies full IP ownership
- Developers need to evolve from coding specialists to problem solvers who manage agentic workflows, as syntax knowledge becomes less valuable
- AI agents provide complete traceability and compliance capabilities that humans cannot match, making code review and regulatory compliance more robust
- The build vs. buy decision is shifting toward building custom solutions since companies typically only use 20% of SaaS features but pay for 100%
- ROI is measured through revenue acceleration and cost savings acceleration, with some clients achieving 60-70% reductions in engineering costs
- Legacy system modernization is becoming feasible even for obscure languages like COBOL through AI agents that can understand and generate compliant code

## Key Takeaways
- **DO:** Start with identifying specific pain points like legacy modernization, slow product releases, or high tech spend rather than doing general POCs
- **DO:** Ensure C-level leadership drives the transformation as cultural changes and organizational restructuring are required
- **DO:** Focus on developing problem-solving skills and deep technology understanding rather than specific programming language expertise
- **DO:** Consider the build vs buy decision differently now that custom software can be delivered faster and cheaper than SaaS implementations
- **DON'T:** Don't focus procurement on unit cost reductions and labor rate negotiations instead of total cost transformation
- **DON'T:** Don't assume traditional IDEs and development tools will remain relevant as agents take over code generation

## Topics
lean software engineering, agentic workflows, SaaS disruption, legacy modernization, developer role evolution, compliance automation, cost transformation

## Full Transcript

>> Hello, everyone.
Scott Hebner here.
Thanks for tuning in to The
Next Frontiers of AI podcast.
Today, we'll answer the question, is the Agile development methodology dead?
We'll discuss whether software as a service will also
become a relic of the past.
With agentic AI at our side, we can now build software 10 times faster and deploy products at scale with significantly fewer resources, and applications become highly modular and composable providing
unprecedented flexibility and adaptability.
This is so different than the era of cloud and SaaS development where companies needed massive
resources to design, build, deploy, and adapt applications.
The democratization of AI
agents is changing everything, creating a new super cycle
in software innovation.
Who knows this world better than anyone?
Well, I vote for Arun Varadarajan,

[01:01]
the Chief Commercial Officer at Ascendion.
Arun is here with us today
to discuss the world of Agile and software as a service
and where it's all heading.
Welcome so much, appreciate
you being here again, Arun.
It's been a while since
we've talked at the AI Agent Builder Summit.
What's new with you and Ascendion?
>> I'm starting to see the
interest level going up significantly in the market.
When we were talking, I
think there was a lot of...
We obviously had a set of marquee clients who had already started working with us on the new operating model, but since we spoke, I don't know what's happened
in the last two months.
It's been a deluge of
clients signing up to say, "Listen, we want to get this
started sooner than later," and then also kind of being
a little disillusioned with some of the tools that
were available in the market that I think were very single-purpose,

[02:01]
just focused on one aspect
of engineering being coding.
When they started looking at our platform and the ability to look at
autonomous engineering from start to finish, they saw a
significant opportunity in changing the game.
We're very excited. We
just started some very interesting work for a very large client.
You know, unfortunately, under
NDA, I'm not in a position to name them, but that's going to be huge.
It's a massive transformation
where the client is more or less committed to using our platform, and they're going through
kind of an initial phase of proving out the approach
in part of their business.
The idea is to take it
across their entire product engineering organization and transform the way software
is getting done using agentic AI, everything from redefining
the process, redefining how their engineers will operate.
What will be the new roles?

[03:02]
Will there need to be a new org structure?
All of that is up in the air, and they have taken a very
aggressive approach in saying, "We want to do this and we want to be the first to really drive this systematically
across the organization.
" I would say last two
months, it's been a lot of, and interestingly, about three clients who are a little concerned
about, should they leverage AI?
Should they even... "Let's
experiment, let's do pilots, let's take easy steps.
" They want to come forward and said, "No, we want
to get this done now.
" It's been an interesting last couple of months since we spoke.
>> That's great, so it sounds
like the demand is kicking in and people are starting
to get a little bit of the message here that
the game is played on the field, not in the dugout.
You got to get going, do more than pilots because you risk falling behind, which you may never catch up with how quickly these innovation
cycles are moving, right?
>> Very true. So, so, so, true, so true.

[04:05]
>> Well, you've argued that Agile is no longer
sufficient in this new era of AI agents where agents can now take over
the engineering workflows, so it begs the question, is Agile dead?
Is it just evolving? Why
do you have this view?
>> I definitely think that Agile needs either a compete rethink or we kill it and look at a new operating model, and I do believe that, I'm calling it lean software engineering because I know a lot of
people say, "Why lean?
" I think lean is a word
that we all understand.
It's about, how do you put
in place a very efficient, effective process that can deliver outcomes
much faster than before?
To me, we are calling it
lean software engineering where we are taking out all the fluff and all the, again, the ceremonies and a lot of this stuff that happens

[05:08]
that doesn't necessarily
drive the velocity of getting things done.
You see, Agile was a
response, like and you and I know, to Waterfall because Waterfall had its limitations.
We built something and by the time we built it
was a long, drawn process.
The requirements changed, right?
>> Right. Mm-hmm.
- We said, "You know what?
We'll be a lot more agile."
The whole idea of Agile was to be agile, truly agile, but I think what has also
happened is over time, I don't think Agile was
designed to be that way.
It's just that over time it's been polluted, if you will.
The way it is implemented today, it doesn't bring the engineering
discipline that we used to have even in the past.
The sprints will come come and go and you will find that
the features that you want to develop are still not fully baked.
The business users are taking that time to decide what to do.
There's a lot of elongation
that happens, and part of it is

[06:08]
because I also think all of us are visual people, you know?
>> Right. - If we can see
something viscerally, we are able to understand and appreciate
what it's all about.
With lean software engineering,
what I'm suggesting is that if I can do these, let's
call them mega sprints.
I don't want the Agile folks
to get all bent out of shape.
I just call them mega
sprints to make them happy, and these mega sprints, what I'm telling the client is you're going to see the entire enchilada, but not necessarily in its final form, but you can see how based
on your initial vision, can I quickly show you how that entire application is going to work?
It's going to be now possible because I'm no longer dependent only on humans to get the work done.
I can actually have these
agentic workflows, one for the presentation layer, one for the business logic layer,
one for the API layer, one for the database layer, and maybe even one for the
infrastructure layer if need be.

[07:09]
I can in parallel attack all these layers and not have, say, "Oh, I'm only addressing business
logic in sprint three.
" I can bring that together and actually very quickly
show my client based on their initial vision, based on what
they think they want, this is what it's going to look like.
When they look at it, they
can say, "Aah, you know, I don't like this.
Change this. I think the workflow needs to to have three steps instead of two steps.
" Or, "I need the UI to look differently," or, "I need to integrate with this system which you haven't considered.
Let's talk about history,
data, migration or whatever.
" Now, those things I can
do in the next iteration.
What happens is in every iteration, I'm incrementally building
across all the layers, getting the clients to have
a complete visual experience or an immersive experience
of the entire application.
Then, at some point in time, I say, "Voila, this is what I want.
Let's switch it over
to production." I feel- >> -
- ...
faster approach- >> Yeah, so-
- ...
.
- ... it's an aggregate of subworkflows

[08:10]
that all come together and
allow you to do things quicker because you're doing things in parallel also. Is that sort of- >> Yeah.
- ... the notion- >> Yeah.
- ...
here? Are you calling
it agentic engineering or lean engineering?
>> I'm calling it lean software engineering because what I'm saying is,
firstly, my team is going to be super lean and it's also going to have a very lean process.
It's going to be cleanly defined.
There's going to be points of interaction that we will define with
the customer right up front, and it'll be a very structured approach to getting things done.
There will be a certain
amount of discipline that will also be required
from the customer side, which I think we have lost in Agile.
To a large extent, the Agile process, if it's not implemented
well has actually led to a lot of indiscipline.
We don't know how much it's
going to cost to build the...
We say, "Hey, we think it's going to cost a million dollars
to do this project.
" I have seen in the
last seven, eight years

[09:11]
or 10 years since Agile has been there, very few people are able
to stay within budget.
Everybody's budget is bloated and that's why we're
facing all the challenges and problems in the tech world with layoffs and everything else.
I just feel that here's a
great opportunity for all of us in the industry to
take a real hard look at how we build software and
develop a lean approach to it.
That's why I'm calling it lean software engineering powered by agentic AI.
>> Right, and that's inclusive of evolving the software
it learns, it adapts to the requirements much more quicker because the whole thing is lean, and it sounds like human
in the loop is a big component of all this- >> Yeah, yeah.
- ...
which brings me to let me show you a little study that I found.
It was actually done by Salesforce, and I think it was in the beginning of March, so it's not too old.
Just a month and a half
or two months ago or so.
The good news is 92% of developers believe that AI agents will advance their careers.

[10:14]
It doesn't sound to me,
at least from this study, and I saw some others out there that were in the similar ballpark there, it sounds to me like developers
are welcoming of this.
It's not, "Oh, it's going to take my job.
" It's going to give them superpowers, and I think that's the
message I think they're getting from all of this.
>> Oh, all our engineers
in S&D are loving it because it brings a lot more
predictability to how they are able to deliver things, right?
>> Yeah. - It gives then,
like you said, superpowers, but I can also tell you that there are some adjustments you
have to make as an engineer for you to be relevant in
the agentic world, right?
>> Mm-hmm.
- Nobody is going to be hired for their skills anymore.
Just because you know Python,
you're not going to get a job.
Just because you know .NET
Core, you're not going to get a job, but if
you are a problem solver that knows how to use software engineering to solve problems, you
are going to be front

[11:15]
and center in this transformation.
In fact, we are getting
to a point where we can pretty much write code using our agents in any damn language you want.
Everything from PL1 or, you know, PL1, which is
60, 70 years old, all the way to the latest programming languages.
We have agents that can write
in any of those languages, so I know...
Let me put it this way. Very
soon, I'm no longer going to need to hire an Arun
because Arun knows .
NET Core, but I had to
do that in the past.
In the past, I had to hire you because I was looking specifically
for engineers who knew .
NET Core, but today, if I
know engineers who know how to write good, how know what
good is from a coding standard, the syntax can be taken
care of by the agent, right?
>> Conceptually, it's sort of like the roles across the software
development life cycle,

[12:16]
they become little managers of their own little digital
workforce that's going to help them not only do their job better and elevate their value, but also partner with other
parts of the life cycle, other people that are managing that.
A lot of it gets automated
through these intelligent agents.
Is that conceptually sort
of what we got going on here as the future goes?
>> Absolutely. Let me tell
you an interesting real- world problem that I'm
solving for a client.
The client came... In fact, we had a very interesting
discussion about two, three weeks ago in one of the conferences.
Client said, "Listen, my
platform is built on Cobalt.
I want to modernize, but I also know, Arun, that
even though you have a platform that can accelerate my modernization, I may not do my modernization
in one big bang.
I will do it over time
because there's risk involved.
There are multiple things involved, but in the meantime, I
also need to make sure that the clients who are on
my Cobalt code base continue to get new features and new capabilities.

[13:17]
I've got to keep them happy
while I'm transforming, and we all know that you
can't find Cobalt programmers that easily, and even if
you find them, they're going to charge you 5, $600 because they believe it's a unique skill.
I told the client, "You
know, hey, we have agents that can decipher Cobalt code and reverse engineer Cobalt code.
I'm gong to build you agents
that can write Cobalt code, so you don't need to hire any more Cobalt knowledgeable engineers.
You need to hire good
engineers who can come in and we will write, we will
generate the Cobalt code for the user stories that you have, convert the Cobalt code
actually into a technical spec that any good programmer can read.
If the technical spec is all right, then the Cobalt code is good.
If the technical spec is
not all right, let him make changes to the technical spec.
I will take that and make sure that the Cobalt code reflects it.
The world is changing, Scott,

[14:18]
and while I continue to look at how we can modernize this Cobalt platform, I'm also helping him
deliver features in the old legacy application.
This is a solution we are looking at.
Those are the kind of changes that tell me that if engineers have to be
successful, in my opinion, they have to really become
truly creative in their thinking in terms of how they solve problems, and must have a deep
understanding of technology and really look at things, have very sound conceptual capabilities.
I'm tell you, in the last 10 years, a lot of the engineers have lost
their grounding on core software engineering principles
because they're busy dragging and dropping stuff and just learning some Python skills or going for a class on .
NET Core and thinking
that they're programmers.
They're coders. They're not programmers, and what we really need in the
new world is true programmers

[15:19]
who now how to program
irrespective of language.
>> Right, and not only are they going to inherently adopt the ability
to build AI capabilities, it sounds like they're going
from a focus on activity to outcomes, and their job
is to make sure the outcomes that the agentic workers are
creating meet the requirements and so on and so for.
Really, it's subtle, but it's profound at
the same time in terms of the changes, right?
>> Absolutely, and in
addition, I also think that that is something that we are
also looking at, that a lot of the applications will also become agentic.
We're using agents, of
course, to build software, but many of the capabilities
in the software products that are now there in the
market will become agentic because that in itself will create a very new playbook in terms
of how applications get built.
It'll be a combination
of traditional software that you write and agentic frameworks

[16:22]
that will really turbocharge
the entire user experience for the end consumer of
that software product.
>> That brings me to another
thing I saw in the survey.
Let me bring that up
here, which is that 82 % of the developers say
that their SDLC platforms, they actually said infrastructure,
needs major upgrades to support this notion
that they're driving here, agentic AI, lean software engineering.
I found this to be
pretty interesting, too.
>> Yeah. You know, I will tell you, I may become unpopular if I say this, but I genuinely believe that these IDEs, these integrated development
environments, are going to become more and more minimized.
What are these IDEs? These IDEs are places where engineers go and write code, but if I have agents writing
the code, why do I need IDEs?

[17:23]
I don't need IDEs, so some of these tools in the software
development life cycle I think will become superfluous and unnecessary as this evolves, so you're absolutely right.
I think the way we design, the way we architect, so I'll
give you another example.
For a large bank today, we are
using our platform to build to replace their
architecture review board.
Wat does the architecture review board do?
They use tools to really analyze and assess whether the design and the code are two standards.
That's what they do, and they
use tools and they use a lot.
There's a lot of human
involvement in the whole process.
We have developed agents
that can actually go and review the design and review your low-level
design, review your code, and see if you're using all
the well-architected principles of Azure or AWS or whatever else.

[18:24]
If there are an anti-patterns,
I can actually recognize what those anti-patterns are and give you remediations
to correct the code so that it becomes compliant.
What you're seeing here is a lot of the processes involved in
the engineering world are going to be dramatically impacted
by these agents and, therefore, a lot of these
tools will probably fall by the wayside and may no
longer be needed and required.
>> Yeah- >> .
- ...
I can see that in the...
I think that's true in other domains. too.
I kind of said in the upfront, the agentic AI movement is
really changing everything.
We'll get into that a little bit later because I got some questions
for you on that, but before we do, if you're
talking to, let's say, a business person, let's
say a CEO, a CFO, in terms of ROI, as you move from your
development teams having an Agile methodology to moving towards
this more lean agentic- based software engineering approach, how

[19:26]
would they measure that?
I mean, is the measurements different?
I mean, I get that you're
getting improved time to value, you're reducing development costs.
I assume here you're elevating quality, but how would you recommend
they would measure that?
Do you have any good
examples, you don't have to name customers, of real
outcomes that have shown that this is definitely the way to go?
>> Oh, for sure. I think you
hit the two simple dimensions.
It's time and it's cost.
These are the two simple dimensions.
We had a client who
recently, a startup, that startup fish company,
they've been, I think, in business for five years.
They're a health tech. They chose us because we were able to show
them that their product release that they had planned
because they had to do a set of activities to get the product ready and ship the product out
in 24 months, we were able to show them that, "Listen, you can get this done in 10 months.
" Suddenly, their business
case was able to introduce

[20:30]
literally five more quarters of earnings.
We actually premium-priced that and we said, "Listen, if you
want to do it in 24 months, okay, we'll do it cheaper, but if you want to get
it done, we are happy to do this in 10 months for you," but they're going to charge you more because we're giving you the value of accelerating your revenue.
I think there is, like I
said, that's one dimension where if I can bring
forward either your revenue or bring forward your savings,
so for another large bank, we are doing their entire
customer service transformation using our platform.
We're actually building an
agentic AI customer service environment, ecosystem
completely for their call center, for their web, and multiple channels.
Now, we were doing the
engineering in terms of building out this agentic platform for them in the traditional way.
In the traditional way, they
have already saved money

[21:32]
and they're likely to save
money at a particular rate.
We went back to them and
said, "Listen, you're going to take probably three, four years to save that total quantum of money, upwards of hundreds of millions of dollars.
" We said, "Using our
method, what if we bring that savings forward and get you to save the same
money in two years instead of waiting for four or five years?
" That's a huge business case,
so acceleration of revenue, acceleration of savings is
obviously a big, big dimension.
The second thing that
some CFOs are telling us, and we've had, again, a conversation with a large tech company
where they believe that they are spending way too much money on their product engineering efforts.
We are working with them to see how can we really change the cost
curve, not do an optimization of 20% or 10%.
We're talking about some 60, 70% savings in their engineering costs

[22:34]
over a period of time.
That is what is building the
business case in that instance.
If I was a CFO or if I was a CEO of a company,
if I'm really struggling to accelerate revenue because somebody is telling
me, "Listen, it's going to take me three years
to launch that product, " agentic AI is a great option.
We can show them how we can bring that revenue acceleration for them.
Secondly, if they have ideas that if they have technology
programs that is going to save them money over time and they're being told
by their IT department that it's going to take
you five years to get that transformation done and you're going to get the
savings over five years, we will show you how you can
take that five-year savings and get it done in two years
and accelerate your savings.
If you're looking at
these two scenarios, CEOs and CFOs, you should
definitely talk to companies that have our kind of capability
to accelerate your revenue and accelerate your savings.
Then, the other things is if
you fundamentally believe a lot

[23:36]
of the I would say B-backed
firms, mid-sized companies, and even large companies feel that their current spend
on technology is very high, you're seeing signs of
layoffs happening across right now, and those are all actions being taken by the really big tech, as I call them.
They're finding efficiencies.
If the smaller companies
who are there in the market are not realizing that that is real, they should think again.
There, again, we have the
playbook to show them, if your tech spend is so
much, we can save you 50, 60% of your tech spend across
product management, across architecture, design,
development, operations, what have you, by using agentic AI.
These are the three, what do I say, broad business imperatives that should drive a CEO or a CFO to reach out to people like us who can help them drive that kind

[24:37]
of business impact in their business.
>> Yeah. Ultimately,
that's the bottom line, and then I think you get the
intangibles of creativity and innovation and higher quality and things like that that are going to be- >>  right.
- ...
a byproduct of... yeah, yeah.
Well, so let me ask you, so we've talked about in the past as you and I back with the AI Agent
Builder Summit about today's agentic technologies,
largely based on LLMs and generative AI, which I don't know if you saw
Apple came out with a study that showed that LLMs really can't reason.
The good news is there's all kinds of technologies coming on the scene and being democratized
as we speak that start to provide semantic reasoning and causal reasoning, that I think when
complementing an LLM is going to change the nature of
these agents in time.
The question for you is,
the vision that you have as these agents are able
to truly reason better, make more trustworthy decisions that can actually explain those
decisions, which I think is where this is all heading,
not so much a black box

[25:39]
and not trying to predict reasoning, but actually do better
mimicking of human reasoning.
I assume this will take
it to a whole new level.
You agree with that?
>> Oh, for sure. See, the one
thing that we're doing, Scott, is we are making sure
that our customers see how the agents are making their decisions.
We have a complete traceability as to, why did the agent choose to
write the user story that way?
Why did the agent choose to write the low- level design that way?
I mean, let me ask you, how will you get that information from a human engineer?
Very tough. You're not
going to be able to get it, but the agent here, you're able to- >>  black boxes, too.
- ...
exactly. They're walking human black box or whatever, living black boxes, but here, I can actually tell the agent, "Tell me why you did that.
Why did you choose that design?
" It'll actually tell you,
I mean, you should see now how much the output of our
agents have improved over time.

[26:41]
It is able to go into, so let's say I train my agent
on somebody's GitHub repo, wherever they have their code base.
It'll actually tell me I don't need to write this piece of code.
It already exists in the repo.
I'm going to pick it up from the repo.
It actually tells you,
"Don't write these methods.
" Recently, actually, we did
a small pilot for a client who use Sterling Commerce, one of IBM's old products.
We are trying to do a
customization for them, and we're in the middle of
doing that work for them.
We found that when we trained
the agent, the agent was able to understand that these are the standards that the Sterling Commerce and the e-commerce engine requires.
Therefore, when I write code, I got to make sure I comply to those standards.
Let me tell you, I used to work for a company called Oracle. I
mean, I'm sure you know them- >> Mm-hmm.
- ...
and I had huge difficult
making sure our consultants

[27:43]
followed the Oracle standards.
It was so difficult, but here,
I trained the agent once.
It's consistently spitting out
code that is super compliant to what Sterling Commerce requires.
That is the huge advantage,
so its ability to understand and appreciate all these
things is only getting better, like you said, and it's
getting more .
>> That's great, and
you're right about humans.
I mean, developers, one thing they hate more
than anything than having to document everything and explain in writing why they've done things a certain way.
You're right, the agents can
probably open it up even more, and it also kind of brings...
I think you kind of
implicitly hit on this, but my research has been showing a bigger and bigger headwind in the
world of AI due to data privacy, security, regulatory compliance, which is all over the
place, all over the world.
You have all... I'm assuming this is going to help out in the whole
world of compliance.
You were kind of referencing policy and compliance to a corporate
standard or a vendor standard, but it's true for
regulatory compliance, too.

[28:45]
It's going to ease that burden.
>> For sure, Scott.
- Yeah.
>> You look at all the data
leakages that have happened, the data breaches that have
happened, they're all happened, sorry to say this, because of human error.
A lot of them have happened
because of human error.
Somebody decided to open a
firewall without whatever.
There could be a hundred things
that the human did, maybe for a valid reason at that point in time, but created vulnerabilities.
Now, with agents, I can
actually prevent that.
I can train them not to do something.
I can say, "Hey, this is
HIPAA-compliant procedures.
PHI data cannot be compromised.
This is PCI-compliant
data. Do not mess with it.
" It will never accept PCI
data unless it's scrambled.
It'll never operate on...

[29:46]
The guardrails that we can set
in place with these agents, in my opinion, will be far more robust than the guardrails
we place on humans because even if...
What guardrails can you place on humans?
You can't tie their hands
up. What can you do?
You can only tell them, "Hey,
it is good governance for you to not do this," but somebody
can still do it. Right?
>> The same, the value of the developer, the people on the life cycle goes up because now they'll be able...
these agents will be able
to generate the compliance documentation to make
sure that they can show, and yeah, again, just more and more things to get
done so they can focus on higher value things.
>> For a life-
- Yeah, so change.
- ...
absolutely. For a life
sciences mid-size firm, we're actually using our
agents to produce all of the documents in the GXP
process, which is so important for compliance because this company sells bioreactors to the large farmers,

[30:46]
and they have to make sure that their manufacturing process
is absolutely compliant and they're able to publish all of the documentation in terms of how all the systems have been validated, the process have been validated.
It's pretty elaborate, so we
are able to do that with agents and it's really helping this
company do things far cheaper and far more consistently than
relying on a human process.
>> Yeah, since last time
we talked, I went to...
We covered at theCUBE the AWS
Financial Services Symposium in New York City last week,
actually it was this week, this week, time doesn't...
This week I was down in Washington, D.C.
, at the AWS DC Summit.
In both places, regulatory
compliance was one of the major themes,
and you're right, part of the trick here to addressing that and turning it, slowing
down that headwind of having to do all that is going to be the agentic approach that you're taking.
>> Yeah.
- I want

[31:48]
to ask you the other
side of the coin here.
We talked about the lean software engineering process for software.
What about software as a service?
I took that middle graphic
from your blog that you write, the trade-off here,
and so is the byproduct of this the world of SaaS is
going to change dramatically?
You can see I found another
study out there, 78% saying that business consumers that are
familiar with agentic AI think that agentic AI will become the
successor to the SaaS model.
I'm curious to your thoughts on that.
I know you've touched on it in your paper.
>> I absolutely believe that
this will be the fourth reason why CEOs and CFOs will start
calling companies like us.
The fourth reason is, if we
all know in the tech world, there's a big decision you have to make,

[32:49]
"Should I build or should I buy?
", before you embark on
any project or initiative.
Today, with agentic AI, that build versus buy decision
has become very interesting because think about it, when
you buy these SaaS products that are there in the
market, the IP is not yours.
Your pace of change is dictated by them.
They decide your pace of innovation.
If you want to introduce a new capability, you're most likely to hear, "Wait for my next release next year.
" You're shackled, and then in any case, you
customized the damn thing because everything is not out-of-the-box.
Then, you have problems with upgrades.
It's a bit of a, in my opinion, it's a golden clasps that you get into.
You just completely get shackled.
Now, the reason why you did that was because you had time-to-market advantage.

[33:51]
The technology wasn't there to build these products fast
enough, so you said, "Okay, damn it, I'm just going to buy, deploy it, and just get to market quickly.
" In my opinion, with
agentic AI coming in, custom software is going to be faster for you for two reasons.
One is, of course, the entire
process is becoming smaller, shorter and shorter and getting shrunk, but more importantly, think about it.
When you buy a SaaS product, 80% of the features you don't use.
You only use 20%.
You go to any client,
they buy the software, they only use 20% of the features,
so you're actually buying that entire a hundred percent
for just the 20%. Now, if I can build software for you that 20%, focused on what you want, the problem solving even becomes smaller.
If I can do it with agentic AI, the cost and time-to-market advantage
is probably in the favor of custom software, and the IP is yours and you can drive the pace of
innovation, and that becomes-

[34:53]
>> That becomes .
- ...
yeah.
A lot of mid-market firms
were scared to do this, build custom software,
because they didn't have the capability.
They said, "We can't have
those kind of people," but with agentic AI, you
can bring partners like us and we'll be able, and I'm
sure there are others in the market, but partners
like us who can come in and do it for you at a
very attractive cost point, not burn your bank, and get you something that
you really want for yourself.
I'm spitting code, so that is your IP.
I'm not a low-code, no-code platform.
That's the other option.
I also think low-code, no- code platforms are also a locket.
You get locked into a
low-code, no-code platform because if you don't have that low-code, no-code platform, you can't run the app.
Low-code, no-code platforms
are also under threat, in my opinion, with the agentic AI because here I am building code that can be then given to
the client, so the client owns the code base.
>> It's truly, yeah, it really is...

[35:54]
it's profoundly transformational.
I mean, that's what I was saying before.
I know our view here, John Furrier, who's one of the CEOs here, we're
on the verge of the dawn of a new super cycle in innovation.
This is why, and actually
let me get your take on...
I've talked to probably a
hundred-plus companies, a lot of them vendors, but some end
user companies mixed in there over the last six months or so.
Let me just show you what I
would aggregate as the keys to future state software.
This is whether you're selling software or you're building it
within your own business.
I think there were five
takeaways here that I've sort of aggregated in all my conversations.
On the bottom left, first of all, you got to tap into an AI ecosystem because there are going to
be agents all over the place.
There's going to be skills
you're going to want to build on AI-native
cloud infrastructures.
A lot of this stuff you can
acquire in the marketplace so you can focus on your added value, so the ecosystem becomes
critically important.

[36:55]
I think your point about not
getting locked into a low-code, no-code environment kind
of plays into that notion, and I've heard that also, Arun.
The second thing is totally
rethink software. Go agentic.
I think that's the case
you're making here.
It's a totally different model.
Don't just assume the SaaS model.
It's a really important
point. You drove that home.
I think the other thing is what I've heard is they're
targeting labor spend, not IT spend- >> Correct.
- ...
and what that's meaning is go
vertical in nuanced markets because if the idea here is
to create digital coworkers, digital labor, if you
will, just think about how many unique skill
sets there are out there.
Even if you are an
accountant, where you live, what business you're living or working for, what industry, I mean, it's a little bit different.
If you're a homeowner
association manager, as I talked to one of the leaders there,
very nuanced skills that have

[37:57]
to make judgments when
they do knowledge work.
Go in these nuanced markets.
Go very vertical in what you
build in terms of your agents, and then power people to do
more than just automate tasks, but actually to make decisions,
pursue goals, problem solve.
If you take all five
of these in aggregate, that is truly a very
different model than SaaS, and to your point, Salesforce or any of these big application providers, you can name hundreds and hundreds of them, are not going to go after the people that are managing homeowner
associations, for example.
They can't cover all of that.
What's your thoughts on
sort of that aggregation of what's really changed
in here in the big picture?
>> Oh, I resonate with every one of them.
I'd like to amplify on
one of them a little bit and then go to where I
see this all trending.
You are so right that if you go to any procurement
organization today in any

[38:58]
of the large enterprises,
their entire focus is on, "How do I reduce my vendor's bill rate?
How do I get more volume discounts?
" Their focus is all on the
unit cost problem, as I call it.
They're not looking at
the total cost of IT.
That is definitely a major, major gap, and I really beseech all CFOs and CEOs to rethink how their procurement
organizations are talking to their IT vendors.
They go and they do these
large contracts with these big, large IT vendors, and all these IT vendors do
is they're not looking at, "How do I do this dramatically different?
"
They're just telling them, "We'll reduce our labor rates by $3, $2.
We will give you volume
discounts." Guess what?
Instead of giving you
better quality resources, because they still want to make their margins, so what do they do?
The bring low-quality
resources to make sure that their margins don't get impacted

[40:00]
and you get bad quality and maybe you've reduced a few dollars, but you're really not getting the value.
I really think that all CEOs and CFOs must go to their
procurement organizations, especially the ones
focused on IT procurement, and change the way they think
about cost transformation.
That's one thing I want to amplify, but looking ahead, Scott,
one of the reasons why Karthik, who's the CEO of Ascendion, he and I, when we started Ascendion,
one of our big goals was to impact a billion lives.
That was a higher order
vision that we had.
We felt that the only way
to impact a billion lives and really impact the wider
populace in the planet was to bring the cost of building
technology dramatically down because that's the only way
we can provide technology access to everybody.
There are a lot of these, like
you said, small businesses that are out there that
simply cannot access the best

[41:00]
technology because it's
too expensive for them.
Even if they go to a Salesforce
or any of these big names, and I hate mentioning,
naming any of these players, they will not get the service they want.
One of our vision by
building this platform was to really democratize the
way technology gets built and delivered at a
significantly lower cost so that we can have may the whole planet boom with technology.
That's where I think this is going.
All the points you raise are bang on.
It completely fits into how we see this story unfolding, and we are
very excited about the future.
>> Yeah, and I think Salesforce,
since I brought them up, I actually think they're
on the absolute right strategy for their business.
Marc Benioff, they were
actually did an interview with theCUBE not too long ago and he made a couple of points
I thought were interesting.
One is he'll be the last CEO of Salesforce that will manage only a human workforce.
Two, is I think what they're
doing with Agentforce

[42:03]
is they're going to help
provide the backbone, but then you can plug in agents
that are much more nuanced, much more vertical.
They're playing that backbone
infrastructure play around, obviously, their core market.
It's not that these big vendors go away, it's just the role changes with these, and I think they're aggressively
moving from software as a service to this notion of agentic AI.
>> Sure. - Before we go here,
though, so for our audience, how can they get started with this?
How can they learn more about Ascendion and what you guys all have
to offer as a way to do that?
>> I think the best way to get
started, in my opinion, is to really identify a pebble in your shoe.
What is that pebble in
the shoe that you have?
One pebble could be, "I've got all of these legacy applications and they're really resource-hogging.
They're not allowing me
to innovate fast enough.

[43:03]
I want to modernize quickly.
" Everybody who comes to you and tells you that modernization
is long, drawn, it's going to cost you a lot of money,
are selling you the wrong idea.
I think you've got to figure
out, what is your pain point?
If your pain point is, like
I said, legacy modernization or you're not able to
introduce products fast enough or you feel your tech
spend is really way over budget, your projects
are getting delayed, all of these are good signals,
in my opinion, for you to really explore agentic AI and how it can change your world.
I mentioned to you there's
that revenue acceleration opportunity, savings
acceleration opportunity, fundamental cost
transformation opportunity, and then the build versus buy position that you want to make.
These are all good triggers
for you reach out to a company that does agentic AI.
With us, we are telling our clients, "Don't do POCs.

[44:07]
"
POC days are gone. This is proven.
We have proof points that we can do this, but maybe you want to start with a pilot.
That's okay. Even if you have
proof points, companies say, "Listen, pilot this for me in this area, and let's see if it works.
" There's also not just us
bringing in this new capability and technology, there's also got to be acceptance at the ground
level on the client side.
There are cultural changes
that need to happen.
People have to embrace this, and somebody from the
top has to drive this.
That is very important.
We are seeing that if the C- level is not involved
in driving this change and transformation,
it's not going to happen because there's a sea change that is happening at the ground level and top. Somebody at the top
has to say, "I'm doing this and let's make it happen, and I want to everybody
lined up to do this.
" That would be my advice to them, and we're working with a wide range of clients across the globe.
We are seeing some very good results, so I would strongly tell all
your listeners that don't wait,

[45:11]
pick up the phone and call us.
We are happy to engage with you and share with you what we
are doing with other clients and the impacts that we are
able to deliver for them.
We're happy to see what we can do for you.
>> Yeah, I can say I've
been highly impressed with what you guys are all doing.
I've seen it live through the demos and the tours that you gave
and really great stuff.
Or anyhow, Arun, it's time for
us to kind of wrap up here, but it's always great talking with you.
The vision you guys
have is very inspiring.
I think you're definitely heading in the right direction here.
>> Scott, thank you for inviting me back.
It's always a pleasure to talk to you, and I think the questions you ask and the discussion we have always, it's a learning experience
for me, so thank you for that.
>> Well, thank you, and we'll
definitely have you back.
We'll keep these conversations going.
For all of you out there,
this agentic AI opportunity, particularly if you're in the
software development space,

[46:11]
is really no longer theoretical.
It's real, it's growing.
It's open to those with clarity
of vision or urgency to act, and as Arun has been saying, the game's played on the
field, not in the dugout.
It's time to act and get involved because this change is
happening and will happen.
To help you out, by the way, make sure you check out
the upcoming broadcast of The AI Agent Builder Summit, which will be on June 25th on thecube.
net, or you can see it
on demand afterwards on our YouTube channel.
You will see more from Arun
going into what they can do, and you'll see a lot of good stuff in a little bit more detail.
I encourage you to go watch
The AI Agent Builder Summit.
I think it'll be very well
worth your time to do that.
Anyhow, thanks for tuning in. Take care.
We'll see you on the next
episode of The Next Frontier of AI.
We are the lead on tech
news analysis. Bye for now.
