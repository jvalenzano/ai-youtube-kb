**Module:** Foundations of AI Agents
**Module Rationale:** This video primarily covers foundational concepts of Agentic AI, market adoption patterns, infrastructure requirements, and strategic considerations for enterprises rather than specific workflows, tools, or case studies

## Summary
- EY's technology pulse poll shows 81% of tech executives are highly optimistic about Agentic AI potential, with 43% increasing AI budgets and over half going to autonomous AI
- Agentic AI represents a shift from individual AI assistants to collaborative autonomous agents that can reason, make decisions, and work together in workflows
- Innovation cycles are moving 5-10x faster than cloud migration, requiring companies to experiment quickly or risk falling behind permanently
- Most enterprises are moving away from building custom models to using RAG approaches and Agentic RAG, with focus on orchestrating pre-built agents
- Trust, adaptability, and decision intelligence are becoming critical requirements as agents move from productivity tools to business-critical decision makers
- Data infrastructure remains the foundation - companies must get their data architecture right before deploying effective AI agents
- Talent crisis emerging with 2.3x more demand than supply for AI professionals, plus 90% of companies unsure what AI skills they actually need
- New business models are emerging based on outcome-based pricing rather than traditional seat-based or transaction-based SaaS models
- Security and privacy concerns are the top barrier to adoption, mentioned by over 75% of survey respondents
- Startups have unprecedented advantages in this cycle, able to target vertical labor spend rather than just IT spend with AI-native approaches

## Key Takeaways
- **DO:** Focus on getting your data infrastructure and architecture in place first - there's no AI without good IA (information architecture)
- **DO:** Start experimenting with AI agents now and build flexible frameworks that allow plugging in and pulling out different solutions as the market evolves
- **DO:** Look for AI agent platforms that support open standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP) to avoid vendor lock-in
- **DO:** Target vertical-specific use cases and labor spend rather than broad horizontal IT applications for maximum impact
- **DON'T:** Don't assume you need to build AI models from scratch - focus on RAG approaches and orchestrating pre-built agents instead
- **DON'T:** Don't get overconfident about your competitive position - benchmark against external market developments, not just internal progress

>> Welcome back to the Next
Frontiers of AI podcast where we feature the industry pioneers who are shaping the future of AI.
Thanks for tuning in. I'm
Scott Hebner, your host and the principal analyst
for AI at SiliconANGLE Media and theCUBE Research.
In this episode, we'll
chart the adoption curve for Agentic AI within the
technology sector with the help of EY, one of the big four global
professional services firms who no doubt has their
pulse on the marketplace.
As we enter what many are
calling the golden age of AI agents, a new market
category is emerging, one that delivers on the growing
demand for highly domain- specific digital workers
who can reason and act and collaborate with humans
to enhance decision-making and to accelerate outcomes and even act autonomously
when human involvement is not feasible or warranted.
As we learn from the recent
AI Agent Builder Summit hosted by theCUBE, now is the best time

[01:02]
to build a new technology business or reset an existing business.
With the emerging Agentic AI technologies, innovators can now build 10 times faster, deploy products at scale, and fuel go to market with
significantly fewer resources.
And more importantly, they can move beyond targeting IT spend and target labor spend, a significantly larger
untapped opportunity.
This is the dawn of a new
supercycle in innovation where vertical expertise, fast iteration, and the use of AI-native
infrastructures will likely reshape the marketplace.
And it's likely to occur
faster than you think.
To explore all this, I'm
excited to have Ken Englund, the Americas technology
sector growth leader at EY, joining us today.
So, Ken, thanks so much for taking the time to be here today.
>> Yeah. Scott, great to be here and looking forward to our conversation.
It's nice to get together.
>> Yeah. And it's always fun doing these.
You get to meet new people and I see that we had a good cross-section

[02:03]
of overlap at IBM.
>> Yeah. The world is small
from that perspective and I was sort of smiling as I was looking at your background and we're in the middle of
another platform shift, right?
A supercycle as you like to call it.
So ready for another one.
>> Yeah. I was in the software group.
You were in the consulting.
>> Yep.
- I guess what they call global business services back then.
>> Yeah. Global business
service at that time. Yeah.
Now I've been at EY about seven years, so still just deep embedded
in high-tech industry.
>> That's great. So a whole bunch of enterprise experience, which is great.
And you're focused on the
technology sector, correct?
>> Yeah. I spend all my time
in high-tech, a lot of time with upstarts, new
private company scale-ups, and then a lot of times still
with big high-tech as well.
So that's all I do day in and day out.
>> All right. That's great. All right.
Let's start, Ken, with just
what is EY's view of the Agentic AI marketplace
or Agentic AI in general and how do you see it being
different from the last three years of generative AI
both from a technology

[03:04]
and business perspective?
>> Yeah. I mean a few things,
Scott, I would start maybe just to lay out our view.
Agentic AI for us is intelligent systems with autonomous agents that either have light human
interaction or fully hands off.
Right? So a pretty broad
definition in that regard.
I sort of feel and EY, we're really
sort of at the coming age of the discussion of what I'll
call the application layer.
If you think of the last two or three years, it's been
really about foundational infrastructure and compute
and large language models.
Now, we're all pretty
excited about actually how does this get deployed and help an enterprise,
which is a big item.
And then for me, as you said, I spend my whole life in the enterprise, so while I'm super excited
about the consumer tech side of AI, the light bulbs are
going on of how we're going to apply this to an enterprise.
Right? That's really it.
And then for me, the biggest thing is, I don't know about you, but this feels 5 or 10 times faster than
cloud migration, right?
This platform shift is light speeds.
I mean, I appreciate
your thoughts as well.
>> Yeah. I would say the aggregate

[04:06]
of all the conversations
I've had on Agentic AI for the last nine months or so would be that people would view AI assistance as what I think most people
are familiar with, right?
Genitive AI based. They're task oriented.
They help you analyze information.
They can help you create content.
Again, repetitive task, it can be.
It's really about the individual, right?
>> Yeah.
- And generative AI has sort of created this gateway into the world of AI in a very similar way that the browser 25 years
ago created a gateway into the online world.
And the AI agents then
take that to the next level and started to add, as you
said, autonomous behavior.
They can talk to each other and
collaborate with each other.
They have greater degrees of,
let's call it, "reasoning, " quote, unquote, where
they can help you plan and make decisions.
And they are really more than just assisting you in a task.
They're actually collaborating
with you as a human being

[05:06]
to give you superpowers and help you do higher
value work even better, so not just productivity
but actual decision-making.
And then Agentic AI is when
you wire these things together into a workflow where
you have multiple humans, perhaps multiple agents,
that are working together.
That's sort of how I would
piece it all together.
>> Yeah. I mean, I think our framework and thinking of mental
models are about the same.
I think for us as well, I mean a lot of discussion is technical
and I've been in it a while.
I believe we'll solve
the technical hurdles.
What I think in the enterprise that's really interesting is
the enterprise incumbents have a tremendous strength, as you
shared on your pods before, but also, they have a tremendous
weakness as well, right?
These incumbents are upstarts and we actually think that
the commercial models are changing pretty significantly.
If you think about some
of these native Agentic AI companies, their commercial
models are totally outcome- based, not seat-based,
not transaction-based, so it's the idea of creating sort of a no- regret buying decision with some of these native AI companies
that are going to be as important as the technology, I think.

[06:07]
>> Yeah. I actually did a
podcast not too long ago with a new startup, two years old, called HOAi, homeowner association, and they targeted the
homeowner association market.
And apparently there's 40,000
of these in the United States.
They support about 40 million
homes across the United States and historically known
as low-rated, in terms of homeowner associations are
always less than three stars.
No one's happy with them. So
they targeted the labor there with a set of AI agents.
And they went from the end of this year 2024 10 customers
to over 60 through April, so the first four months, now
covering over a million homes.
And their secret was you target
the labor spend in a very vertical market where the big
guys like Salesforce aren't going to target homeowner
associations, right?
>> Mm-hmm.
- And you capture the nuances of how people work there, the knowledge work.

[07:07]
We have to make judgments and I think that's part of the key.
And then to your point,
it's not like the SaaS model of the past or the cloud model because you're able to
build off these cloud- native infrastructures and
build these agents quicker and even use agents to build agents, so you can move so much quicker.
And you're right also on the
innovation cycles are just...
Think about it. It's only, what,
two and a half years ago we got into generative AI and now we're moving on,
so much faster than cloud.
>> Yeah. I mean, Scott, for us, the most important thing we talk to clients about these days
are just getting their sort of Agentic frameworks
correct because our view or sort of my personal
view is if you think about enterprises, they're
pretty brittle, right?
I mean you've got ERPs and
CRMs and enterprise data marts.
To change those things is
pretty difficult these days and we see the pace of change of products, buy versus build models, the ability to build some extensibility
into these frameworks, to plug in and pull out is going to be super critical in terms
of just, as you mentioned,

[08:08]
the rapid pace of innovation.
>> Yeah. So you guys at EY
recently released your latest technology pulse poll and
it was focused on Agentic AI and I think it targeted
the technology sector.
Can you explain a little
bit about the objectives of the survey and a
little bit more detail on who you targeted, who participated?
>> Yeah. Absolutely. I'll give
you a little bit of context.
We started these surveys
back in 2022, so four or five years ago, and
originally they were really just to get sort of the pulse and thinking of high-tech executives around their broader industry.
What ended up happening,
we've conducted six of them.
We do a couple of them a year.
We just did this one April.
The last two years have almost
all been about AI, right?
Everything we talk more
broadly about is narrowed down, so those are our topics.
We surveyed 500 tech executives
in companies that have 5,000 or more people, so these aren't startups, to really get a pulse of what's on their mind from that perspective.
So that's a little bit of
it about the background of the survey.
>> The one thing that popped
out to me was, what was it, 80,

[09:12]
81% are highly optimistic
about the potential of Agentic AI and AI
agents? It's a big number.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I think
two things I'd say there.
It actually is a big number.
I think a couple of really
interesting things for me as we talk about high-tech
versus other industries, there's a little selection
bias in there too, right?
These are all high-tech execs.
All these technology
waves start in high-tech.
And I think part of the reason for the optimum is if you
think about maybe the two most high-value, high-impact
use cases today, it's around software development, coding, and customer care, and agents.
And I use sort of high-tech as the leading indicator of that, right?
They are making serious traction in those spaces from that perspective.
>> Yeah. There's no doubt.
This one also jumped out at me too, the 43%, that they're actually
increasing their budgets in AI and more than half of it
is going to autonomous AI, which I guess is agents, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah. So I would
say very broadly Agentic AI.

[10:14]
And I think, Scott, three things there.
Like you said, I mean,
it's one of those surprise, not surprise, so two things I would say as we look at these surveys
longitudinally, the amount of money and interest people
are budgeting continues to increase 10 points up from last year.
And then really, as you can feel, those dollars are now
shifting away from core infrastructure, just
large language models, to really agents, right?
How are we going to deploy
this out in the field?
And it's pretty natural, right?
We're seeing direct line of
POCs moving into production, scale up, so the budgets are going up 10%.
90% of the survey said their budgets are increasing around AI.
Right.
>> That's pretty incredible because the budgets over the last couple of years have become really
high anyhow for AI, so it seems like the
Agentic is an added layer of additional investment
on top of the core AI that's already been put in place.
Is that a fair observation?
>> Yeah. I think of it as sort of fundamental investments have been made and now we're sort of
extracting the benefit

[11:17]
of it from an Agentic perspective.
Again, what I view more broadly, I think about these workflows and cross-platform workflows as sort of inter platform and intra, right?
So a lot of the work right
now is going on within these ecosystems, intra.
It could be Oracle, SAP,
Workday, Salesforce, and everybody is starting
to tilt a little bit about how do we integrate that workflow across a
variety of platforms.
I think it's really early days, but that's where the line of sight is.
>> Tell me more about these numbers here, which is also very interesting about the autonomous... A lot of progress.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So a lot of progress and again, I think back to
the comment I made about, I'll just call it, intra-platform, so within a particular
infrastructure, we're seeing adoption of agents in that space,
around care, chat, just simple knowledge
tasks, and those activities.
But I mean really we were a
little bit surprised just in the pace of the next 24 months that more than half the
executives are going

[12:18]
to really expand their
deployments of autonomous, right?
So we really view it as sort of this is when people
are going to see work above the waterline, right?
Whether you're a customer,
a vendor, an employee, we've been talking about AI a lot, but it's really been building
up all the things under the waterline and now we're sort of moving into what
people are going to see.
So I think reasonably ambitious
over the next 24 months to drive that Agentic work forward.
>> Yeah. So I think what
you've learned so far was that these comments are very
optimistic about the potential, almost game-changing.
I think you see that big of a number, 81%, and they're already well invested.
Almost half, 43%, have
some degree of these agents that are already deployed
and increasingly autonomous and the investment is going
to go up even further.
>> Yeah.
- So it brings me to I'd just like to get your view on some of the research that we did here at theCUBE Research on.

[13:18]
Let me bring this up here.
On the tech priorities.
Basically, what this is
saying is if you were to ask the technology folks...
And this is not just within
technology companies, but this is across both
technology companies and enterprise accounts, about
what are the key technologies that are really key in terms of priorities to build out the promise of Agentic AI?
And LLMs certainly make a
lot of sense at the top, but some of these are really interesting.
>> Yeah. Scott, this is a great slide.
I mean I violently agree
with sort of all of these.
I think two things I'd say
right off the bat, maybe just to pivot back to the prior
discussion about why aren't people moving forward with AI.
Right? There's a small group of people and of them, maybe 40% of discussions around the use cases they chose didn't drive the ROI they wanted.
About an equal percentage
really have slowed their AI investment because they want to get data and infrastructure in place.
Right? So when I sort
of look at this slide,

[14:19]
if you think about the
LLMs, some of the work around databases overall, I would add graph
databases in there as well as a big item from that perspective.
And one of the funniest conversations...
At least I think it's funny when I talk with a client or a prospect.
I sort of walk in first and
say kind of, "How's your data?
" Right? And we kind of all know the answer in an enterprise.
The data is tough. And then I say, "Well, think about your normal data, then think about adding vector
databases, graph databases, other external content.
You really have to get your
act in order around that.
" Now, we actually think
Agentic RAG will solve some of this activity as we go forward, but for me, I actually think the multi- agent workflows are going to be really critical
from that perspective.
And then the tool integration
is really important, I think.
For me, I get excited about...
A really simple example
is if you took an LLM, a GPT model and you ask it to do math, the answer is historically changed.
If you go back to GPT-3,

[15:21]
maybe you get the right
answer, maybe you don't.
But in common terms now,
these models are going to call other deterministic
tool usage, right?
So for me, what I get really
excited about these priorities here, and it falls into decision
intelligence as well, is how do we add deterministic
pieces into this probabilistic model?
Right? That's what the
enterprise is going to want, so those are really critical there.
And obviously all the reasoning
items are on your list and I violently agree
with all those as well.
>> Yeah. My take on all
this is three big things that are becoming increasingly
important in the world of Agentic AI, right?
One is trust is becoming
the currency of innovation.
And it's one thing to
have GenAI assistants that are helping individual productivity.
It's another whole thing to
have agents working within a workflow and help you make
actual, in many cases, business critical decisions.
You have to be able to trust it and trust it means humans have to trust it and they're going to trust it
more if it can explain itself

[16:22]
on why to do something, not
just tell you to do something or come up with an answer.
And then of course you get
into all the world of security and you get in the world of privacy and regulatory compliance issues, so trust is a big thing.
I think the second one is this
notion of being able to adapt as your environment around you adapts.
GenAI and LLMs on their own,
they basically encode what we know about the past and create correlations to
help predict the future, but if you're going to make
judgments into the future, it has to be to adapt with
the conditions around you, so it has to be adaptable.
And then the third thing
I think is the decision intelligence where, again,
they're going to have to have additional
technologies built around them to actually provide the ability to make trustworthy decisions and be able to explain those decisions and do what-if analysis and
counterfactual reasoning.
Like you said, that's where
you got to build around it

[17:23]
with things like graph
databases, knowledge graphs, some of the causal AI stuff.
And I think that's what was in
that line that said semantic and causal reasoning.
I think the graph stuff fits in there. I assume that's
what you mean, right? Like- >> Yeah.
No. Absolutely, Scott. I
would make two other comments.
I think you totally have
nailed the discussion of how do you build a confidence level?
For us, two things were
really interesting, and we may even touch on it later, but a part of the survey,
the biggest concern of all these companies is
around security and privacy.
Over three quarters of
the respondents said that is their biggest gating item.
A fair distance back our
discussions around commercial terms and legal and all of that,
but top of mind is this.
And what is interesting was
if you go back a year ago, I'll describe it much broadly as observability was probably
at the top of the list.
How do these things work and all of that?
So, Scott, to your point that
these need to be trusted, we got a long ways to go, but I think in the last year, we've taken quite a step forward.

[18:25]
If you think about the
chain of thought, reasoning that's occurring, it's not
going to happen overnight, but the confidence levels and the results are definitely moving up.
Right.
>> Yeah. It's definitely a journey, right?
There's no binary on and off, and whether you do decision intelligence or whether you're explainable, I think it's a progression, right?
>> Yeah.
- And like you said, chain of thought.
And then you got semantic reasoning, being the knowledge graphs
that kind of understand context and they understand
relationships between entities, and the meaning in terms of
how they relate to each other.
And then causal starts to infuse cause and effect in the journey that
we're going to be on here.
And it was interesting that
73%, I mean, security goes back to your point a little
while ago about step one is to get your data in place, right?
There's no AI without an IA and IA being information architecture.
So without data, your AI is
not going to be as useful as you want it to be, right?

[19:25]
>> Yeah. Yeah. But I think- >> In fact, the most important
focus right now is still getting that data layer.
>> Yeah. It's a lifelong
journey and we're seeing...
Like I said, I mean if you
think about the transactional data, it continues to need to get better.
And then all these other data sources, other external sources,
we really think about that as a really critical item
and just a lot of work and not a lot of people see
it from that perspective.
So it's like digging in the trenches, but that's what you need, right?
>> Yeah. Get that data
infrastructure in place and then you got to build the models and your GenAI infrastructure
on top of that.
Like in clouds, you've got
to have a cloud provider that can also support your
private cloud infrastructure.
And then you can start to
build the ecosystem of models and agents around that, so
it is a journey for sure.
>> Yeah. I think, Scott, a
good segue into models, right?
So who's building them? Who's
buying them and all that?
And I think it's been really
kind an enlightening experience that I have seen.

[20:26]
From my view, kind of in tech,
everybody sort of jumped in and thought they had to
build their own models.
That was sort of the natural course and back to some of the talent discussions that we'll have like,
"How many data scientists and research do you want you
want to build your models?
" I think what we've seen personally is it evolved from everybody
wanted to build their models, so think it was fine to get a
fundamental understanding of how these models work, so
people should build models, but in the broader sense,
the discussion then shifted to maybe we just need to fine-tune models.
And that has sort of evolved as well.
Actually, where I'd say
most enterprises are, most really had sort of
moved down the discussion around RAG from that perspective.
And when you think about RAG and chunking, I mean there's still a lot of work and a grind of a work.
So from there, I think
this whole discussion around Agentic RAG, which
if you think about it, it was a nascent idea just 12 months ago, LangChain and all these things.
And it's really only coming
into the consciousness in the last six months, five months,

[21:26]
but we actually think the number
of companies that are going to have to build ground-up models is going to be relatively small
from that perspective.
And using these models
in the right purpose and small language models and all of that will be
the case, so that's kind of what we're seeing out there in the space.
I don't know why. Are you
seeing something similar?
>> Yeah. No. I'm seeing the same thing.
We call it small language models, but we kind of equate the S to be in small but also specialized in
sovereign and secure.
It has all the S's, right?
And I think you're right on
because you get a general purpose model as the global
intelligence sucks up the internet essentially
and then you build your very domain-specific models around it.
Many of which you can
purchase on the open market.
Well, there's over a
million models on Hugging Face, for example, now.
Bring them in. You customize them and you have to bill very few.
I've also been seeing
research that is showing that even when it comes to buying

[22:27]
or to agents, that about half
the companies out there plan to actually acquire agents
either as part of their SaaS applications or separately customize them and plug them into a
smaller number of domain- specific agents that
they build that's unique to their business, so it becomes truly a composable model, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah. No. I'm smiling only because my head already
thinks about like...
I describe it very broadly
about orchestration of agents across the enterprise.
Right? So not just within
an individual platform or orchestrating multiple
agents to accomplish a task.
And my perspective right now
is within the major platforms, it's almost a no-regret decision to apply those agents in those space.
Whether you're an AP or AR or quoting or something like that, that's great, but to us, the real thought
process going is to who's going to win the orchestration
across the enterprise?
Is it going to be
traditionally our PCRM players who have incumbency,
but there's quite a bit

[23:29]
of vendor lock-in backlash?
Is it going to be the hyperscalers or is it going to be another set of orchestrators out on the market?
That will be the critical
decision to be made and if you can drive some
optionality in waiting to make that decision while you're doing sort of the smaller agent work is kind of the recommendation, at
least at this point, right?
Things are changing pretty fast.
>> Yeah. I think a big criteria for success for the Agentic platforms
is going to be the ability to take any agent from
anywhere regardless of origin and plug it into a workflow.
The worst thing that some of
these companies can do is lock people into their platform
as the only source of building agents, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah. Well,
Scott, I'm super excited and Microsoft put a lot of
attention on it last week or the week before in Build, but MCP, the Model Context Protocol.
They won't be the only one,
Ada and some of these others, but I am super excited
about just seeing some of these competitors
at least lining up now around driving some standards.
I mean, people will say it's a fancy API,

[24:30]
but I think there's a little
bit more intelligence to this, a little bit more two-way work status.
So seeing things like MCP are really going to make a difference.
I'm not smart enough to know who's going to win the standards war, but we're heading in the right
direction a lot earlier than I'd say with some other platform shifts.
>> Yeah. Well, we covered a
bunch of events this month or I guess it's still May.
IBM announced MCP support
in watsonx Orchestrate.
Commercetools, one of the bigger commerce
platforms out there, they announced MCP support.
And then just recently,
I think, was it AWS?
It was either AWS or SAS, but you can already see it
be getting adopted into these platforms and again, that's
going to be another key to keeping it open, so you're right.
What's interesting here is the innovation cycles are moving so fast.
They're moving at warp speed.

[25:33]
The game is played on the
field, not in the dugout, so you got to get out
and start experimenting and playing with this stuff because with innovation cycles moving
that quickly, if you fall behind, you may never catch up.
Where in the cloud world and
prior to that with mobile and client server and all that stuff, you had
a little bit of luxury to see how things kind of shape.
>> Yeah. Scott, it's
funny you mentioned that because I heard recently something
that really interests me, was we're 20 years into
the cloud migration, right?
So think 20 years from now
in the AI migration, what, 2045?
Are we still going to be migrating to AI or is it just going to be ubiquitous?
Right? So it's moving
a lot faster, I think, so flexibility is .
>> When you see what Google put out with...
Was it Veo, with the video, the movies?
And then you see some of
the videos of the prototype of the Tesla robots folding
laundry, cooking food.

[26:33]
You start to say like, "Can you
imagine five years from now?
It's going to be a whole new world." >> Yeah.
>> Well, let's transition to one thing that's really been at a center of my attention over the last
many months, which is talent.
Why don't you explain a little
bit about the findings here because this could be a
real problem for companies?
>> Yeah. Yeah. A few things, Scott.
I'd say this is fairly intuitive, but there's another piece
of data I'll share as well.
Companies, there's certainly
a supply-demand imbalance, as you've talked about in the past.
A lot of upskilling going
on from that perspective.
Still a lot of AI-specific hiring going on and a lot of just intentional
hiring overall, right?
84%. What's really interesting
that isn't on this slide is 12 months ago, we asked
as far as employees and displacement of
employees via AI, about 20%

[27:34]
of the respondents said they
expected displacement from AI solely, not incremental add, reskilling.
That number has actually moved down to about 10%, so half as much.
So for us, a real keen insight here is for these tech companies, it isn't so much about removing workforce.
It's upskilling and also the belief that
the total amount of work and productivity can happen,
we're going to need AI for, so that number's really shifted down on those who just thought this was a cost- saving exercise from that perspective.
>> Yeah. As you kind of referenced
and we talked a little bit before we got started
on the podcast today, and bring up one of our charts here, which I think complements
what you guys found, which is our view of this emerging talent crisis.
You mentioned the supply and demand gap.
Our research shows it to be about 2.
3 times more demand for AI professionals than
there is in the marketplace.
And interesting enough,
from one of the HR firms,

[28:35]
they came out with a study that showed 9 and 10 aren't even sure exactly what talent needs they have to have.
They're still trying to figure out what exactly is the ideal
profile of the AI talent for their organization.
And obviously people are
struggling to find the talent and even the talent they
got is at risk of leaving for higher-paying jobs because some of this research, we found 47% premium being put on finding the best AI skills out there.
So there is a battle to get to the skills that you can then hire and actually retain within your business.
People can't lose focus on that and the cultural elements of
all this. Would you agree?
>> Yeah. Well, yeah. No.
I 100% agree and your sort of second
point is the one that to me is the most interesting, about not really knowing the
talent skill sets they need.
The way I think about this is
things are moving pretty fast

[29:37]
and, Scott, my reference point is how many people did we need to build compilers back in the day versus how many people did we need to write assembler versus using the tools?
Right? And I think we're still
at a very early stage as to how many people do we
need to build the tools and how many people do we need
to know how to use the tools?
And that's going to continue
to ebb and flow back and forth, so there's no equilibrium in supply, demand at this point.
And I don't think we totally know.
If somebody came to me and told me they knew what
their requirements were on AI, that's where I'd have
some disbelief, right?
>> Yeah. There's whole new
professions getting created.
Another thing that we had written about was software developers.
Actually, this is one of my
AI predictions for the year that software developers
become data scientists.
What I mean by that is the
software development profession in the SDLC, with the help of
agents, they're actually going to be able to build AI models

[30:38]
and build agents, so it
starts to beg the question.
Is there a fused profession
coming up now where you're two sides of the coin,
you're a software developer, but you're also a data scientist
who can build AI stuff?
>> Yeah. Yeah.
- And it's- >> It's really interesting, Scott, because I get a lot of people come and say like, "My kid's going to college.
What should they learn and train in?
" And it's an impossible answer.
I mean, my answer to them is a simple one.
Make sure you're good at using AI tools because I don't know if
being a computer scientist or EE or an ME is going to be
totally clear in four years.
I mean, it's going to totally
evolve from that perspective.
>> Yeah. No. It definitely is
and I think like you said, the best thing to do is
be a user of this stuff.
Get out and use Veo and all these.
Every week, there seems to
be these new things coming out from different providers.
And play around with them because I think you build your own skills around this stuff. Right?
>> Yeah. Yeah. No. Absolutely.

[31:39]
Scott, just maybe the funniest or at least the thing that
brings me the most humor in the pulse survey response was
there's obviously a high level of confidence and optimism around AI.
And we ask a question about,
where are you relative to your competitors?
Mind you, we ask, what's
driving your AI usage?
And simple top three, being competitive as a company, a better
customer experience, and making sure we're on
point with our strategy.
That's the reason they say
they're deploying this.
So you ask them, how are you
doing against your competitors?
Right? And nearly 60% of them say, "We're more competitive than
the people we're chasing.
" And I described this as, well, that's statistically not possible that all of you could be more.
It's like saying are you an
above average driver, right?
So my point is just that people
have asked their executives for a ton of money to go do AI things, so there's a natural human point

[32:42]
to make sure you show in
best light your AI work to get more funding and stuff.
So my only point is that I
think it's super important, while it's early days, to make sure you're
benchmarking competitively outside in versus just kind
of talking about stuff inside.
Right? So podcasts like this, really explaining what's on the horizon, to give you a yardstick to measure against your progress
I think is super important because the yardstick's
changing literally every week, if not every day.
>> Yeah. You have the added dimension too that there's no better time
to be a startup than now, as I was kind of alluding to earlier.
You could see markets getting
really disrupted again, sort of like what happened with
the emergence of the internet.
It changed everything. And
you can't get overconfident.
You're right. If you have
63% saying that they're ahead of their competition,
something doesn't add up there and you're not even including
startups, right? This wasn't- >> Yeah.
- ...
really a startup survey because 90% of startups, by
the way, I think there's 17,

[33:44]
000 startups in the United States alone.
I think it's closer to 70,000
AI startups around the globe and it's projected, 90% of
them will end up failing.
>> Yeah. If not more probably, Scott.
I mean, in some areas though,
what's important is like around coding tools and stuff, it's starting
to narrow down to three or five major likely winners and stuff.
And we'll see more of
that, so I kind of think of 2026 is sort of a year of
some consolidation coming up.
Not totally. We're not going
to know all the winners, but it's going to narrow down
a little bit on that front as we go forward.
The other thing for me, I mean pretty much everything
we've talked today about is the existing workflows, right?
You think about record a
report, payables, all this sort of stuff, how we apply these
things, but these tools and Agentic models and everything are going to
drive totally new workflows.
We just haven't thought
about them because we're kind of pattern matching against
what's there today, right?
If you think about the sales
motion in a big corporate

[34:45]
company at an individual or SMB, small and medium business,
they either pass that off to a distributor or a reseller.
The ability to have Agentic workflows in that whole sales motion,
brand new workflows that maybe a company just kind
of outsourced to the channel, that may all change, right?
So we're thinking very
traditionally about these models, but there's going to be
some great new workflows that we just hadn't thought about because we didn't have the time or money or horsepower to do it.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Deterministic and not pre-coded and pretty thought out.
They learn as they go and it
could really change things.
You kind of alluded to the
overconfidence could actually become an inhibitor if
you're overconfident.
Is there any other inhibitors that jump out in the technology aside- >> Yeah.
I mean, to me, it's ironic that that would be the case, right?
I think that overconfidence
creates blind spots, right?
And I always think within tech, there's a very big not
invented here syndrome,

[35:46]
so I think being open-minded about it.
I think in broader industry sense, I think it's about taking
some more calculated risks and moving forward a little
bit faster in particular areas and monitoring and measuring.
We're definitely seeing a lot
more discussion now about ROI, actual measuring outcomes, so
I think that's really critical for folks to make sure they're measuring appropriately as to what they're doing.
And I think up till now it's
been okay. Logical investment.
Let's see what happens.
Now, I think it's going to look much more like
a traditional investment that has happened over the last 20 years, right? How do you fund these?
>> As a business.
- Yeah.
>> Well, look, I think
your survey clearly shows that technology companies
are the ones that are sort of driving the rapid
adoption of Agentic AI.
They're out in front, right?
>> Yeah. - You think this is
going to overflow into other sectors pretty quickly?
>> Oh, yeah. I mean, it's
already happening I think to the degree that the optimism will follow
in these other sectors, right?
And again, chat, agent,
care, coding will be first,

[36:48]
testing.
All of these things, it's coming.
I don't know an industry
that isn't pretty excited and moving relatively fast, but I think they're going
to continue to look in tech and say, "I can move faster," right?
>> Yeah. Again, you got
to be careful these days.
You fall behind and
it's going to be harder and harder to catch up because
things are moving so quickly.
All right. Well, I think
it's time for us to wrap up.
Frankly, Ken, I can go
on forever and ever here.
I love having these conversations, but I really appreciate, Ken, you taking the time to be here.
This was a great discussion.
I think very meaningful too.
Insights are gold, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah. No. Thanks, Scott.
I really appreciate it and
learned quite a bit from you as well, so thanks for the time.
>> You bet and I look
forward to keeping in touch.
There's no doubt that
we're at the entry here of the golden age of AI
agents, as I said earlier, so I think this opportunity
is no longer theoretical.
It's real. It's growing.
It's available with those
that have the clarity and vision to act with
urgency and just get going.

[37:48]
I encourage you all to check
out the AI Agent Builder Summit that we recently hosted on thecube.
net. It's also on our YouTube channel.
It featured 20 innovators
from 12 companies sharing best practices on actually building AI agents and Agentic workflows.
I think it'll be a time well spent.
Again, thank you all for
tuning in. Take care.
We'll see you on the next
episode of the Next Frontiers of AI podcast.
We are the leader in
tech news and analysis.
We'll see you next time
around. Thanks, everybody.
