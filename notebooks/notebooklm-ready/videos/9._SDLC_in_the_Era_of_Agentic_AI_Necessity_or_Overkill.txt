**Video ID:** QOikWctqYFA
**Channel:** SiliconANGLE theCUBE
**Duration:** 32:16
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOikWctqYFA

**Module:** Agentic Workflows & Orchestration
**Module Rationale:** The video focuses extensively on software development lifecycle workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and how AI agents integrate into development processes and methodologies

## Summary
- Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) integration with AI agents is becoming a necessity, not overkill, as organizations advance their AI capabilities
- AI is transforming software development by serving as a productivity tool that enables faster delivery, better quality control, and operational efficiencies
- Production applications using AI jumped from 18% to 54% in six months, showing rapid adoption in enterprise environments
- Software developers are evolving to become more like data scientists, with citizen developers also creating applications using low-code/no-code AI tools
- AI will not replace software developers but will give them 'superpowers' to focus on higher-value innovation while automating routine tasks
- Organizations are hiring generalists over specialists (67% preference) due to AI tools making complex work more accessible
- Fragmented toolchains (6-15 different tools) create complexity and fragile SDLCs, driving need for unified platform approaches
- Human-in-the-loop remains essential for accountability, especially for compliance, governance, and reputation management
- Legacy application modernization through AI agents can bridge heritage systems with modern interfaces without full rewrites

## Key Takeaways
- **DO:** Integrate AI into your SDLC processes now to avoid competitive disadvantage - it's a necessity for 2025 and beyond
- **DO:** Consider unified platform approaches over fragmented toolchains to reduce complexity and single points of failure
- **DO:** Maintain human accountability and oversight when using AI-generated code, especially for compliance and governance
- **DON'T:** Don't blindly use AI code snippets without proper review and accountability measures in place
- **DON'T:** Don't expect AI to completely replace developers - focus on augmentation rather than replacement strategies
- **DO:** Evaluate build vs buy decisions for AI platforms - most organizations benefit from vendor solutions that provide 80% of needed functionality

## Full Transcript

>> Welcome to another episode of theCube Research's Next
Frontiers of AI podcast.
I'm your host, Scott Hebner, and thank you for joining today.
We're going to continue our
discussions on what's shaping the future of AI, and with innovation cycles
moving at warp speed, staying up- to-date is more important than ever, and more importantly, knowing how to get started sooner
rather than later may be the difference between becoming a leader or a laggard when it comes to establishing competitive advantage.
Today, we'll discuss the role of software development life
cycle platforms in the emerging area of Agentic AI.
Is it a necessity or is it overkill?
We'll also get into how the role of software developers may be changing or may not be changing in the years ahead.
These are meaningful
questions to consider now, as the longer you wait, the more difficult
appropriate change will be.
Today, you think about it.

[01:01]
You've got no-code, low-code
platforms, allowing more and more people to create
AI-driven apps and agents and automations without really
writing any code at all.
At the same time, we have software developers
building the core applications that make businesses operate.
But as AI solutions
become more sophisticated, when they have to start
to reason and learn and help make decisions and problem-solve and dynamically adapt to
real-world changes in the business and the environment that
they operate in, the role and complexity of software
in these AI systems just has to increase, no?
And probably increase a lot.
Won't the software that
runs these businesses need to start incorporating
more and more AI agents and AI models?
To explore these questions and debate whether AI-driven
solutions should embrace or escape the boundaries of a software development life
cycle platform, I'm joined by Paul Nashawaty.
He's a prominent industry analyst, you probably all know him.

[02:01]
He's here at theCube Research now, and he's focused on
application development and modernization and cloud native.
He's here to share his insights and have a good discussion with us on where this is all heading in the future.
Paul, really appreciate you
taking the time to be here.
There you are.
>> There I am. I showed
up. Look it, I'm here.
>> All right, there you are.
Again, thanks for being here.
I appreciate it. What
you've been up to lately?
I know, boy, you've been doing a lot.
I know you're working
on a summit coming up, that we'll talk a little bit later, on what else is going on in the
world of software development and app dev and
modernization and all that.
>> Oh, it's definitely a fun
place to be at this time.
The app dev world focuses on
day zero, day one, day two, and DevSecOps, so build
release operations, anything in the CICD pipeline and anything that touches the SDLC.

[03:01]
This is, obviously, having
AI in the conversation, is relative and important
to the discussion.
>> Yeah. What are you
seeing in your research and your engagements with both end-users?
I know you talked with a
ton of vendors out there.
How is AI helping to actually improve and automate the software
development lifecycle?
How do you see that where we are today?
Where do you think it's
heading in the years ahead?
>> Yeah. AI is interesting, in my mind.
The way I see it is, AI is a tool.
When you look at the software
development lifecycle, or the SDLC, developers are using AI to help accelerate their
delivery of these applications.
Whether it's testing or
quality control or delivery or whatever it may be,
AI is a big part of that, but AI is an enabler
to make it successful.
And by doing so, the AI
allows for the developers to be more productive and have operational efficiencies that they didn't have previously.

[04:04]
>> Yeah. Actually, when I was
doing a little bit of study, whenever I do these podcasts,
I take it as an opportunity to learn, there was actually
a good case study on the AWS blog out there,
about what they're doing with IBM consulting to automate the whole end-to-end cycle.
You can see on the left, what they've done in this
project is they've brought in Amazon Bedrock and all of its AI and Generative AI capabilities.
And then, on the right is,
a little hard to read here, I can see, but the diagram that represents the IBM software development
lifecycle when they're building custom applications for clients.
What's interesting about the case study and their experience, you can
see the value on the right- hand side of the chart here, that equates to a lot
of money, doesn't it?
When you're building these
applications, spitting them out, being able to adapt quickly and get new things, new capabilities out?
>> Well, absolutely, and
when you look at the volume of applications that are being created,

[05:04]
organizations can't do the same thing that they were doing previously.
They need technology stacks
like what Amazon Bedrock and IBM is doing in order to accelerate the development processes.
The nice thing about that slide that you were showing
is it meets the clients where they're on their own journey.
They can basically use AI
as a small piece of it, if they're not very mature yet, and try to get to using
functional parts of it in order to deliver specific
parts of the application, or they can take a full- on automated approach
across the CICD pipeline.
I really like the way this slide really outlines that information.
>> Yeah, it's an incremental
progressive journey.
You take different parts of
it, not just the human elements of a team, but different
parts of the life cycle.
You can apply AI to automate
it and help improve the quality and all the things we saw
in that previous chart.
That's my observation. I'm not
as deep into it as you are.

[06:05]
I'm looking through the
lens of the AI lens, but it certainly seems to be and has been one of the top use cases.
IT overall has been the
top use case for AI.
Then, observability, software development,
those are all at the top.
>> Yeah, absolutely. A
recent research study I ran, I'll say I ran the study a year ago.
It goes a little bit further back now.
What we found is production
applications, we use 18% of production applications we use in AI.
We ran that study roughly
about six months ago, maybe a little bit more, and we found that that number jumped from 18% to 54%.
The number of production applications
using in AI is increasing, and that number now is
significantly higher.
AI and production applications
is going and growing.
It's definitely an area
that's going to ...
We're not looking back. We're
not turning around going, "We're not going to use AI.
" That tech stack that you showed helps accelerate the SDLC.

[07:07]
>> Yeah. Certainly, a movement, and again, every time I
see a study, as I said, software development is definitely one of the top use cases being applied today, certainly for Generative AI.
Let's shift a little bit
to actual developers, software developers in particular.
As I think you know, one of my
six predictions for 2025 was that, how did I state it?
Software developers are going
to become data scientists?
>> Yeah. - Before you comment
on that, let me just, with my best friend now, who I hang
out with all the time, ChatGPT, I asked it to do a little work for me and let me put it up here.
I guess, what it used here, and this is obviously
illustrative in nature, but it used the Bureau of
Business of Label Statistics.
Stack Overflow survey,
GitHub, McKenzie, what is it?
Boston Consulting Group, Gartner, it cranked all this numbers, and what you're looking at here is, I guess the yellowish gold on the bottom,

[08:11]
is the compounded growth rate of software developers that are involved in AI projects.
Think of them as AI software developers, and they're projected that
in 2025, so this year, there'll be 25,000 of
those type people added, but by the time you get
to 2020, it's going to be more than 200,000 per year.
The top one, the red, which has grown even more
aggressively, are the number of software developers
each year that are going to gain data science and AI skills.
I found that interesting.
It clearly indicates that the
nature of the role is going to change one way or the other with AI really coming on the scene and becoming more prominent and widespread across the organizations.
>> Yeah, I think that when
you look at this chart here, you hit on it right upfront
in the conversation.

[09:12]
You mentioned low-code, no-code solutions.
Now, I want to double-click
a little bit down on that.
What we're seeing in the
application development world is the proliferation of applications
being developed is growing substantially, as I mentioned.
The problem is the professional
developers are not the only ones creating applications.
I love your prediction by saying that software developers
would become data scientists, because the reality of
it is with no-code, low- code solutions, citizen
developers now become application developers and they're
creating applications.
If you're a business
analyst, a financial analyst, whatever it may be, if you crunch data and you write an application to work on your data
set, you're a developer.
Now, you're using that
information in order to grow and build, and using tools
like AI will help accelerate that growth process.
Now, I will caution.
I will say that organizations that use AI can't just blindly
use these code snippets

[10:16]
that come out of AI.
They have to have accountability.
Sorry, there's a lot of pollen
in the air. It's killing me.
>> It's springtime. It's
springtime, baby. Yeah, I know.
I've been down there a lot in the spring.
>> Spring time, I love it. But
basically, what we find is the citizen developers are
using these applications, they are becoming, the data
scientists are developing their own applications, and they're
using these AI tools in order to create these applications, but the accountability has to
be there with the business.
>> Yeah. The other thing I
found in some of the research, and I'm not sure it's widespread yet, it's probably very small
number of organizations, some of them are looking to kill tubers with one stone, if you will.
Rather than hire a software engineer and then hire a separate AI engineer or a data scientist, they're trying to fuse it into one role,
which I found interesting.
I think that's a little bit beyond what, maybe it's the top part of the
graph that I showed before, but that was an interesting set

[11:18]
of comments I saw in one survey.
>> Yeah. I'll overlay
that comment with some of my research on skill
gap issues and challenges.
What we find in the app dev
research, we find that 67% of organizations are hiring
generalists over specialists.
Part of that reason is because, to your point, well, one, they can't find a specialist, because if they do find a specialist, they're probably consumed or asking an insane
amount of money that the organizations don't fund.
Second thing is the generalists that they're hiring are able
to do the work previously that a specialist was doing.
What organizations are doing
is they're pushing back heavily on vendors to institute
less complex, easy-to- use solutions, and having a generalist doing the work that a specialist
would've done in the past.
That's where I think that
there's a dovetailing two things together, using AI, allowing
for the ease-of-use,

[12:20]
faster time to value with using AI to deliver your application.
But having a generalist do
the work, you don't have to have a professional developer
or a specialist do the job, and those professionals, developers, and specialists that are in
the company can focus on high- value innovation and not focus on tedious
more remedial type of work.
>> Yeah. No, I think that's right on.
The question that
everyone's asking everywhere for almost every role with AI going even more
aggressively on the scene is, is it going to replace
software developers?
Is it going to replace those
that are responsible for, in the broader IT organization, but let's stick to software developers.
What's your view on that?
>> Yeah. I like your chart that showed the growth in the adoption.
I think that today, would you replace all
your development team with

[13:21]
new college hires or
interns to do the job?
The answer is no, because you need experience,
you need levels of knowledge and knowledge transfer, etc.
Working with AI and working with today's
auto-generated code, it's almost the equivalent of an entry- level kind of deployment or a junior-level coder.
The code may work, it
may not be optimized, it may not be perfect, but it may not be the best code for the solution you're trying to provide.
Will it get there? Probably,
at some point, yes.
I think if you look at
your chart in the adoption that you were showing earlier, I think that's when you're going
to see that operational efficiencies increase significantly.
But today, I don't think we're there yet.
You still require a human in the loop, and that human in the loop
is going to create the code, maybe push the big green button
and push it out the door, but at the end of the day,
the human in the loop is going

[14:21]
to be the one that's accountable for delivering that software.
>> Yeah. I'm of the viewpoint
that it's not going to replace software developers and probably not maybe forever, because when you use AI
to help automate some of these things you have a choice to make, you can save money and cut costs, or you can do more quicker with
higher quality and innovate and grow your business and
grow your customer set.
Even if you weren't doing it,
I just don't see it happening.
In fact, Paul, this is a true story.
When I was getting ready
this morning for this, a thing popped up, a YouTube
thing popped up on my phone and it was our old friend, Scott Moore, from a podcast I did
with him for a while ago.
Let me just show you a clip,
which kind of, I think, answers my view that- >>  you're wondering,
"How does that affect me?
" It sounds like it's going to take over what they do. Is that right?
>> There are some people
thinking that agents are going to replace humans.
I'm not of that belief.

[15:21]
I think it's going to give
the developers superpowers.
It's going to allow them to do things with better quality at
a much faster speed, and it's going to allow
them to focus on the things that are most important and differentiated in what
they're trying to build.
You think so?
>> Yeah, I think so. The way I look at what you just showed is a screwdriver and a drill, a power drill.
Did a power drill replace contractors for doing their job?
No, but it made them more
efficient at putting, say, screws in the wall, so to speak, with the power drill versus
having to do a hand turn with the hand screwdriver.
That's where I think the
analogy works very well with AI and software development.
You're going to have a
developer that's going to be better in having faster quality and faster delivery and
operational efficiencies,

[16:22]
but you're not going to have
AI just completely replaced.
There might be things like bedtime scripts and automation for maybe,
Terraform or Ansible or something to that effect,
that might be turning things on and turning things off, which
has been around for a while, but that's something that seems to be logical when it comes to automation.
I don't see that ...
maybe, what we'll see is we'll see, if an application breaks, AI will go in and go identify, "This section
of code needs to be fixed, and I suggest this section
of code to replace it.
" But I still believe, I truly
believe that somebody has to hit the button, because if
that section of code goes in, and say, if it's financial or PII data or whatever it may be and that goes out to the public,
the company that pushed out that code, now their reputation,
compliance regulation and governance are broken, and now there can be financial impacts

[17:24]
or legal causes or issues.
That is something that the
accountability still lies with the developer and the organization.
>> Human in loop forever, I
think, it's just going to have to be the case, at least
when I'm still alive, maybe a hundred years from now
or something like that.
I think you're a hundred percent right, and I guess, the more the AI
helps automate these kinds of tasks for the developers, the higher value things they can focus on, which is a good thing.
If anything, it's going
to empower developers to become even more strategic and do more important things than just the example you just gave,
which could be automated.
I think it's a good thing.
Let's transition here a little bit to the actual software
development lifecycle platforms.
Given your expertise in this
for a long, long, long time, as we think about how AI
agents are, the development of these AI agents, I should
say, they're going to evolve,

[18:25]
they're going to become a
little bit more sophisticated, do you see it requiring
the integration of an SDLC?
Certainly, the methodologies
and an actual platforms, because today, I don't think a lot of it's being done in
the context of an SDLC.
>> There is some. I think when
you look at API management, API gateways, traditionally, we would say, before the AI agent word came into play, you would use an API gateway, an API call in your SDLC process, in your pipeline throughout the
CICD pipeline, you would use that call for application to
call on another application.
Or if you're using a
service mesh for East-West or North-South traffic
for the API gateways and such, that's how data
was communicated before.
What I'm seeing in a modern use case that I think AI agents are
really going to accelerate here, is from a modernization perspective,

[19:26]
there are heritage applications.
When I speak in my practice, I talk about past, present, and future.
There's heritage applications that basically need to be
taken into consideration.
Those applications, in
order to modernize them, can be modernized a
number of different ways.
One could be taking that application, that monolithic application, and encapsulating it
as a system of record.
If you build a new system of
engagement in the front end with, say, a React application or a mobile application,
whatever it may be, and that application then accesses that previous heritage application, now you have a modernized front-end for that heritage application.
I see AI agents doing just that.
AI agents in the SDLC are going
to help with the ecosystem around the entire delivery process of these modernization of applications.

[20:26]
That's where I think it's going to evolve, and the integration across the
SDLC is really going to help with that staged approach in that journey for organizations.
Because those heritage systems of record, they may sit in place for
9, 18 months and never move, and just use it as what
we would call them an LLM.
We'll call them an LLM or SLM,
and then, that data set is now being used for modernized apps.
Case in point, have you
done a bank transaction recently on your phone?
Have you gone on an airplane?
Those weren't mainframes in the backend.
You're not running a
mainframe on your phone, you're running a system of
engagement on your phone that's accessing that data.
>> Yeah. An interesting
consideration too is many of the enterprise AI
projects actually fail due to poor lifecycle
management of the models.
It causes model drift and biases
and things of that nature.

[21:28]
I think a lot of these
platforms don't really have, and I'm talking about the AI development, the model development platforms, they don't really have robust
SDLC capabilities in them.
As you start to get into
these world, the agents, and they're going to be doing
more than just automating simple tasks, and they have to
deal with the dynamic nature of that and the conditions
around, it seems to me that one option is you start
seeing things like WatsonX and SageMaker integrating the
SDLC capabilities into it, but then you end up with
two different platforms, because clearly, you're
going to have the software development, your core
software applications.
There's got to, at some point, be some synergy between these things.
Otherwise, you're just
replicating another silo of lifecycle management.
>> Yeah. That's problematic, because what we find in our
research is that there's 75% of respondents in an
847-respondent survey indicated that they use 6 to 15 different tools
across their ecosystem.

[22:29]
In 2025, 54% of those respondents indicated
that they want to remove the distributed tools that
they're using in favor of a unified approach.
Having all these different
tools in these different pipelines causes complexity, and it also causes a very fragile SDLC, because now, you have all
these single points of failure, all these little areas that can drop, and then now you're not delivering code.
What we also find that is,
from another data point, and of course, I'm sorry,
I'm an analyst, I'm going to throw out data
points, that's what I do, but 24% of those respondents
indicated that they want to ship code on an hourly basis,
yet only 8% are able to do so, and that's a big problem.
When you look at it,
if the business KPI is to release code on an
hourly basis, you have 6 to 15 different tools in place in order to harmonize your ecosystem, and then your SDLC becomes very fragile and fragmented, it's
very, very complicated.

[23:31]
That's where, I think, the AI agents, I think the platform approach and taking that dynamic data and applying it across the agent to have it help harmonize
the delivery, I think, will unify the approach.
>> I just think my gut tells me that, as we start seeing more and more sophisticated
use cases for Agentic AI, there's going to need
to be a lot of software that manages the interplay
among the AI agents and the underlying AI model ecosystem.
And of course, it's going to
have to tap into connectors, to data and transactional
systems and all that stuff.
I want to ask you about, again, to elaborate a little bit more on what you were just saying about.
I wonder how much software is going to get integrated in all this.
And before you answer, let me
just show you a chart here.
There we go. Just as an example.
This is from the BMW group.

[24:35]
This is one of the podcasts
I had done earlier.
This is actually a causal
knowledge graph, so an AI graph of a supply chain that
they're modeling at BMW.
Each one of those blue
things is an entity, and those entities have
relationships, and those, because it's causal, it's
not just a relationship between the two entities in
terms of context and meaning and sort of a static drawing,
it's actually dynamic because it understands the cause and effect mechanisms
between the entities.
So, if one entity changes or something changes
in terms of conditions, like a factory goes on strike
or the weather a hurricane or inflation rate goes up or whatever, the whole system
then dynamically changes, but it's meant to model a supply chain.
I'm looking at this stuff
and saying, "Okay, I get, the agents are going to
be able to tap into this, but there's got to be
software that gets infused in how these things even more
intelligently interact.

[25:36]
And then, the
transformations, I don't know how we start doing a lot
of this without a lot of software code, I guess is my thought as I look at these things
becoming more sophisticated, and that is a very
sophisticated set of next- generational AI that they're working on.
>> Yeah, for sure. I think
that, one I really love, BMW use cases.
BMW is the leading edge when
it comes to tech companies.
They have so much tech and they're right up there on the bleeding edge, which I really love.
When I think about it, I
think of, to your point, the platform approach is where many organizations are rolling to.
Now, the challenge is
a lot of organizations find themselves with this
dilemma, where they have to put together a platform in
order for it to deliver to what you're talking about,
reduce the complexity, the interdependencies
across the ecosystem,

[26:38]
and make sure things are working.
Now, what they typically
run into is the question of, do you build it yourself,
or do you buy it?
So, build versus buy conversation.
There are many platforms out there that will get you faster time
to value, rapid response, unified approach, and do the entire ecosystem without having to put your entire development
team on point in order to build a platform unified approach.
Now, can you customize
it? Is it perfect? No.
It's not perfect, but it will get you to 80% of the way there.
For most of organizations,
that's good enough.
The devils are in the detail.
If you build it yourself, you own it.
If something breaks, you have to fix it.
Most of these organizations,
unless you're from banking and FinServe, they really don't have a lot of bench strength in order to do the work.
If they do have the bench strength, those people are consumed
doing their daily jobs.

[27:40]
I'm an advocate of working with vendors that have a unified platform
to have software in the SDLC and the platform in the SDLC to unify to remove those obstacles and enable the developers
to create those applications to involve advanced AI
in their overall process.
That's where I think that will
eliminate friction points.
It'll also eliminate the, I should say, it will allow organizations to hit their business KPIs faster.
>> Yeah. Well, we're
running out of time here.
I know you got to go onto
another meeting here, but the bottom line thought
here is, is the integration of the SDLC into the AI agent development process a necessity or is it overkill?
Why don't you frame that in
today's 2025, maybe 2027, in 2030?
>> Yeah. Scott, if you're an organization that's not using AI today,
you're falling behind the 8-ball.

[28:45]
Every organization is
using AI to some capacity.
If you don't have integration of AI into your SDLC
for model development, first and foremost, I'll
stake this claim that today and moving forward, it is a necessity.
Now, maturity of that can vary.
It is a necessity, because if you don't do it, you're at a competitive disadvantage.
Your competitors in the
market will pass you.
If you're not using AI,
you're going to be viewed as a legacy or a heritage way or approach to do things, which is only going to slow you down.
I think that that's where
organizations need to take that into consideration,
that if they don't use AI or don't invest in AI solutions today or capabilities today, they're going to be at a competitive
disadvantage, not just today, but in the future as well.
>> Yeah, a hundred percent
in agreement with you.

[29:46]
Look, first of all,
everyone should make sure that they're following Paul
and he has a podcast going on.
You can go to the same, thecube.net
and look under Programs.
It will be there, or you
can go to thecuberesearch.
com under podcasts. Make
sure you go to see Paul.
Before I wrap up here, let me just bring you up-to-speed here on
the AI Agent Builder Summit.
It's coming quickly, April 16.
We're going to get into
some of this stuff, not hardcore software development and application
development, but certainly, how agents get built and
how they get wired together.
Paul, you're going to get an
invite to be a part of this with us, because I think
it's an important part that extends on this conversation here.
>> .
- Yeah, mark that on your calendar, that's coming up.
And also, Paul, you have an application
development summit coming up too, if you want to put a plug in for that.
>> Summit is, we're targeting June,

[30:46]
and it's going to cover
everything from day zero, day one, day two, and the DevSecOps
aspects of the CICD pipeline and anything that touches the SDLC.
It aligns to the conversation
we're having today.
Doesn't go into deep AI, but it goes into the
processes around using AI to enable the success of the SDLC.
>> Yeah, that's great. We got
a lot of good summits coming up, so make sure you track them all.
And Paul, thank you very,
very much for being here.
This has been a great, great conversation.
It's time for us to wrap up
here, so thanks once again, for all of you for taking
the time to be here.

meaningful discussion, and we appreciate you
