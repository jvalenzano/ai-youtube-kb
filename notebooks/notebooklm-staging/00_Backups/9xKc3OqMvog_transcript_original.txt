**Video ID:** 9xKc3OqMvog
**Channel:** SiliconANGLE theCUBE
**Duration:** 40:36
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xKc3OqMvog

**Module:** Case Studies & Lessons
**Module Rationale:** The video presents real-world examples of AI talent challenges, specific company implementations like BairesDev's talent retention tool, and practical case studies of how organizations are addressing the AI skills shortage

## Summary
- 90% of companies are accelerating AI spending, but 90% of leaders don't understand their AI talent needs or team proficiency
- Only 2% of organizations believe they're on track to achieve AI organizational maturity
- AI talent shortage affects both PhD-level ML engineers and applied AI engineers who can implement existing models
- There's a 2.3x gap between AI talent supply and demand currently, projected to reach 10x gap for new entrants vs. new jobs
- Software developers are increasingly taking on AI engineer roles, creating hybrid professions
- AI agents are already being deployed as coworkers for code reviews, testing, and automation tasks
- Companies should focus on team skill mix rather than seeking 'unicorn' developers with all capabilities
- Talent augmentation through outsourcing and AI agents is becoming essential to bridge the skills gap
- New graduates struggle to find AI jobs despite high demand due to companies preferring experienced candidates
- BairesDev's AI-powered talent retention tool reduced attrition by 50% using predictive analytics

## Key Takeaways
- **DO:** Focus on building a good mix of skillsets across a full team rather than seeking one person who can do everything
- **DO:** Train existing software developers and other roles (UX/UI, QA, DevOps, project managers) on AI tools and agents
- **DO:** Utilize a three-pronged approach: existing team members, talent augmentation partners, and AI agents working together
- **DO:** Act quickly on talent strategy as hiring processes take 3-6 months while AI landscape changes rapidly
- **DON'T:** Don't try to find the 'unicorn' or 'purple squirrel' developer who can handle front-end, back-end, cloud infrastructure, and AI integration
- **DON'T:** Don't put all institutional knowledge in one person who might leave, creating single points of failure

## Full Transcript

>> Hello and welcome back
to the Next Frontiers of AI podcast, our 20th episode.
Our objective is to partner
with industry pioneers to explore the challenges,
innovation, strategies, and real-world stories shaping
the future of enterprise AI.
I'm Scott Hebner, your host and principal analyst for
AI at theCUBE Research.
Thanks for tuning in.
Today, we're going to tackle what I believe is one of the most mission- critical imperatives
facing enterprises in 2025, the AI talent crisis.
There's little doubt that AI
represents the transformative force of our time, and that's why nine in 10
companies are accelerating AI technology spending, with most declaring it
their most important and strategic priority.
Yet while technology investments soar, a parallel imperative is
being left somewhere up in the stratosphere of leadership attention.
The imperative is to win the
battle for the best people.

[01:01]
And here's the reality, a
recent Pluralsight survey of more than 1,200
technology leaders found that nine in 10 do not have
a complete understanding of their AI talent needs or the proficiency of their AI teams that
they have right now.
So think about that. Nine in
10 leaders are accelerating technology spend and nine in 10 leaders are unsure of their talent foundation.
That gap should stop every
executive in their tracks.
The stats are daunting.
Only 2% believe they are
on the road map to achieve organizational maturity for AI.
90% of CXOs admit that
they're not confident that they're building a
future-ready skill base for AI disruption.
Seven in 10 tech leaders
say their org is struggling to secure or retain AI talent, and that jumped up from
28% only two years ago.
Meanwhile, generative AI and agentic roles have
surged more than 1800%

[02:01]
and it's a global problem.
In India, for example, for every 10 open generative AI roles, there's only one qualified applicant.
The bottom line, AI skills
market is becoming the battleground with enormous stakes.
And if pathways of transformation
are any guide, talent and culture, not the technology,
will determine who leads, who lags and who simply fails.
Business as usual won't cut it any longer.
In this episode we'll
go beneath the headlines to explore the hidden forces
shaping the AI talent crisis, the demand-supply imbalance,
the retention fault lines, the global sourcing
shifts that are underway, the way agentic AI may reduce
dependencies on human capital and the advent of hybrid
adaptive professions, thanks to the world of AI agents.
Joining me today to unpack
all of this is Justice Erolin, Chief Technology Officer of BairesDev.

[03:04]
Justice is on the front lines of building and scaling AI teams for some of the world's most innovative companies, and he brings a unique perspective on what it will really
take to close that gap.
So Justice, thanks so
much for taking the time to be here. Welcome to the show.
>> Nice to be here, Scott.
Thank you for having me.
>> You bet. So why don't we
just start with a little bit of background on your background.
So can you just tell us a
little bit about your personal journey that led you to where you are now, as CTO at BairesDev and maybe give us and our audience a little
bit of background on what your company is all about?
>> So I started in my career
close to 25 years ago as an engineer, as a simple .
NET engineer. Moved into
front end development, then into data engineering and then moved into what I
would call the foundations of what AI is today.
That's essentially data analytics, data engineering, data modeling.

[04:05]
I did that for about
five years in advertising and looked through a number of
different attribution models to see how we can find out what advertising works for the largest brands in the world.
One of my projects had to
deal with building out, what we called at the time, an omni- attribution model, essentially.
Multi-touch, multi-channel, and I looked to BairesDev for
help, to help augment my team.
I fell in love with the
whole process of trying to find the right people, of getting the right folks in the room.
And eventually I came on board because I was so in love
with the process that, let me put it this way, I was so, so
hard that I became an employee and that's how I started
here at BairesDev.
>> That's awesome. I wish I
knew you a long time ago when I was a CMO at IBM because attribution models
are the most contested thing

[05:07]
besides the quota models.
>> Exactly.
- , right.
It's like does marketing really do that?
And is the advertising really paying off?
And what about this campaign?
So I know it's a complicated space and hopefully AI is
going to help bring a lot of value to that over time.
>> We could do a whole
podcast just on that.
>> Yes, you can. No doubt about it.
All right, well let me
frame with a graphic the whole conversation
that I'm hoping to have with you today.
And I think this sets the stage here.
So 74% of enterprises,
according to our research, are reporting that they're struggling to find qualified AI talent.
And they're also saying 40%
of existing AI skills, people, the employees that have them
are actually considering leaving for other jobs.
So if seven in 10 can't
find the right talent, and then four in 10 are
having a problem retaining that talent, and the result of

[06:08]
that is something like anywhere from a 50% to 100% increase in salaries that many of these AI skilled people are getting.
So the market's becoming more expensive, which makes it harder to find
people, harder to retain.
Is this what you're seeing
as you are out there with, obviously, a lot more companies talking about talent than I am?
>> Yeah, absolutely. It's
essentially the great resignation, but part two, and now it's fueled by AI.
What's interesting about that stat is the shortage isn't just PhD level machine learning engineers.
These are not just folks that
have the academic background to build out AI models, but it's also the applied
AI engineers, the folks that can responsibly incorporate
AI into production using models from OpenAI, from
Google, from Meta, et cetera.
And so it's two sides of that coin, and I would say the bulk
of that 74% are going

[07:09]
to be on the applied AI side.
The ones that make the news,
the ones that you see from Meta and OpenAI, where they're
stealing each other's AI engineers, I want to say that's a fairly low percentage and that's not for every company.
If you're building out, let's call it, if you're a tire shop and you're trying to apply AI
into your current ecosystem, you're not hiring an OpenAI ML engineer that has five PhDs.
You're looking for somebody
that understands the technology and can apply it to your
specific business case.
>> Yeah. No, I am with you on that.
And while some companies
may need PhD-level skills, most don't, but even given that, I think the talent is quite daunting.
I mean, just one of the things that we do as industry analysts at the beginning of every year is we provide predictions.
And so I put out six
predictions back in January

[08:11]
for enterprise AI, and two of them are really
relevant to, I think, our conversation today.
So one, I argued that
there's two big shifts that will shape the AI talent marketplace.
First, software developers
are increasingly taking on the role of data scientists and AI engineers.
And second, enterprises are
inevitably going to turn to AI talent augmentation.
And that would be through outsourcing and through the application of AI agents to bridge those gaps.
So from your vantage point, are you seeing this trend play out and how are they shaping the AI talent marketplace?
I mean, do you think I'm on the right path and, be honest obviously,
that those are two big things that need to change and
be addressed ?
>> Yeah, that first prediction
that you mentioned, of having software engineers be AI engineers, that's currently in play.
I don't think that's prediction
anymore. That's a reality.

[09:12]
But what I'm seeing now is that there are companies that want it all.
They want a single person
that can do, that can build out their front end, their back end, build out their cloud infrastructure and also integrate with AI models.
We're no longer looking at unicorns, we're looking at a purple
squirrel at that point.
We are trying to find the one person that could do everything, and with current salary ranges, now you're looking at even a higher rate.
What companies should be doing
instead is looking at a good mix of skillsets across a full team, and not just putting all
their eggs in one basket, on one person because that
person does have churn later on, in the future, which is part
of career growth, part of what most people do.
Now all of that domain
knowledge, all of that institutional knowledge is out the window.
>> Right. And that's why, and
I also think just the pure

[10:13]
supply and demand numbers that we'll get to in a second here, because
I got a graphic on that, is you're not going to be
able to hire enough people.
So you're going to have,
directly hire into your company.
So then there's companies
like what you guys do, that can help augment
those skills with people.
And then there's the AI agents, which we'll get a little
bit into a little bit later.
But back on that first prediction, let me just bring up a graphic here.
This is some of our research and the yellow line is
showing the growth in software developers.
Actually it has, the queue is wrong here, but the yellow line is
the software developers.
So there's going to be a 25,000 growth in newly hired
software developers this year.
That doesn't mean the total number higher, just from the previous year.
So it's incrementing, and by 2030 it would be 200,000 a year.
So obviously software development
type skills are becoming increasingly in demand.
But look at the red line.

[11:14]
Those are the, what we would
maybe call a hybrid role here, which is there's software engineers that are also AI engineers and that skill set is fusing together.
So our data shows in 2025, 190, 000 new roles will be hired for that type of hybrid role.
But look, it goes up
to 800,000 by 2030, so that's a 36% compounded growth rate.
So the expectation is if
you're a software developer and you want to continue to
be viable and make good salary and have meaningful jobs, building out those AI skills are going to be absolutely critical, right?
>> Right. We did a study
on our side as well.
Devs at our company are,
I would say at least half of devs in our company, are
looking for AI and ML skills.
And so we've been training
them constantly over the past few months.
I would say since January,
we've trained at least half of our engineers on the use of AI tools

[12:16]
and AI agents to help augment
their existing workflow, their existing development workflow.
And that's allowed us to,
number one, speed up velocity for our clients, where we can get more features
built out in a constrained amount of time and also increase productivity of our engineers.
But two, it allows us to
essentially retain that talent because now that they had
the need to be trained, we trained them and then
now they're actually using that within production-level environments.
>> Yeah. The challenge is
going to be that pure AI- skilled people coming out of universities and existing jobs, there's
not going to be enough of them and therefore you have to,
again, augment them with up- skilling existing people
like software developers.
And again, we'll keep coming
back to the AI agents, which we'll get into,
and the augmentation.
And part of the reason, if
we peel these statistics back even a little bit more, I'll
bring up another chart here.

[13:18]
What we're finding here is first
of all, there's, right now, in terms of jobs that are
being posted, there's a 2.
3 times gap in supply and demand.
In other words, the demand is
significantly higher than the ability for people to hire.
The supply is simply not there.
I believe it's going to
get worse as time goes by, if we don't do something differently.
Because if you look at higher education, so this is universities and not just PhDs, but basically any university at any level, there's a 4.
4 times gap in their
ability to meet the demand.
They don't have the capacity to bring in enough people
fast enough to then spit out.
And what's resulting out there,
as we go through time here, is a 10 times gap in new entrants that have the skills versus new jobs.
They're creeping into the marketplace, but the need for the new jobs and the hiring is just
going through the ceiling.
That's a very, very daunting problem, not

[14:19]
to beat a dead horse here.
And that's why I'm really
intrigued by these ideas of hybrid professions, like the
software developers becoming AI engineers, companies
like what you guys do, which you can come in and quickly and efficiently augment the skills by sourcing them from different
parts, like in Latin America and things like that, even on site.
And then the big unknown is how much of a role are these agents going to take as they mature over time?
It's a really fascinating conversation and there's so much technology
discussion going on out there, and I follow this
marketplace for a living and just not enough on
the talent side of things, as we're pointing out here.
>> Yeah. And there's
another, I would say even, maybe anecdotal.
What I'm seeing in the
market are new grads are having a hard time landing a job.
Even though there's plenty of
jobs out there, the problem is that companies aren't willing to take a bet on a new grad.
And so they would rather hire

[15:23]
a senior level dev or a dev with experience,
with AI experience, rather than a junior developer with zero production level experience.
And so let's say five years
from now, you're going to have a bunch of senior level
devs that have AI experience that are now retiring or
getting out of the market or moving to leadership roles, and they're not getting backfilled with previously junior level devs
that have now the experience of a senior level dev
to take on the mantle.
So there's going to be
a big gap, not only now, but even worse in five to 10 years, where the market's going
to shrink even more.
>> Right. So the way things are right now, just in the United States, this
gap probably means hundreds of thousands of jobs will remain unfilled.
And it's interesting that
people aren't willing to take the risk of newly
skilled people coming out

[16:24]
of universities and
building that new talent with such a huge gap.
And the only way to get around that gap is offer a lot more
money in terms of salary and bonus and all that stuff, which is not necessarily
affordable for everybody.
So what do you think's really
underneath this imbalance?
Is it really just the demand is so high and we don't have the skills?
But you're pointing out
there's actually a reluctance to bring in new people and they're trying to repurpose existing people.
Is that what you think's
at the core of it?
>> No, they're trying to
use, so some clients, let's say they have 10 openings,
right, 10 potential roles.
They'll get an influx of
hundreds of applicants that are brand new from university and they'll deny every
single one of them, partly because they don't have
the production level experience that they're looking for.
What I'm seeing instead
is that they're looking to augment their team with folks like us, which we're more than happy to do,

[17:25]
but now we're essentially
creating this bubble of talent that we'll keep
retaining the experience and not giving it to the new generation of engineers, coming forward.
It's a dangerous game that we're playing and we're going to have to pay for it in about five to 10 years.
>> Yeah, fascinating. I want
to get your take on this.
On a recent podcast that I
did with Arun Varadarajan, who's at Ascendion, they're basically, they have hundreds of agents.
They're basically redefining, reimagining the software
development lifecycle and with agentic AI.
And he argues this notion
that Agile is going to die a slow death, that
technical skills, like people that have Python and things
of that nature, are going to become less central to
success with the advent of AI agents because they're
going to take on so much more

[18:25]
of the design, execution.
And the people that they're
going to want to hire, I think, which what you're saying
connects with me, is people that have more experience, that are able to actually guide the process,
make strategic decisions.
The emphasis is on directing
the agents versus doing all the heavy duty work.
And let me just show you a
chart that we used during that conversation, and this is the notion of this
adaptable hybrid profession, where agents today are starting to automate tasks, generate
code, help you do testing.
They're absolutely amazing at that because they can build
off repeatable patterns of what worked in the past, and they have enormous, obviously, ability to do statistical, swimming
in these huge data lakes and of code and all that stuff.
Where it's heading though
is these agents are going to start actually helping
these developers make the right

[19:26]
decisions and understand the
consequences of those decisions and problem solve.
In other words, it becomes
more goal-oriented.
I want to build this versus
telling it that you need to write code to do something,
which is more task-oriented.
And eventually these AI agentic workflows, these platforms are going to
have autonomous automation with hundreds of these agents and they become effectively digital labor.
They're digital coworkers
that are then managed by the people that are responsible
for designing, building, testing, and deploying and maintaining the software
versus them doing it all themselves, which puts less of a burden on the
hardcore technical skills.
So curious to your take on that.
In other words, where do you
see agentic AI, AI agents, as they actually become truly intelligent and decision-making entities,
which they aren't today, but they're going to
head in that direction.
Changes the game a lot, doesn't it?
>> Yeah, so AI agents
are already coworkers.

[20:27]
We have deployed them
already within BairesDev.
We're using them for a number of different tests like code
reviews, test creations, test automations, things of that nature.
As you mentioned, repetitive tasks that follow a specific pattern.
What matters here is what you mentioned, is the orchestration of those agents, and that's where engineers
really come into play.
And that's where we essentially
can guide agents safely in a production-level environment, so that way we're taking off some of that low- level tasks from an engineer and have them focus on the
higher strategic items, like architecture, design, systems- level thinking, et cetera.
Are they going to go in and ensure that a function is very strictly written Python?
No, the agent can do that, but that doesn't mean
that they stop learning and understanding Python
and understanding the nuts and bolts of the technical ecosystem.

[21:28]
It just means that
they're doing less of it.
There's an internal joke for folks that are developers.
The worst part of being a dev is reading someone else's code.
But now with AI agents, that's
almost your primary job.
So there's still going to
be that need to understand what the agent has written or has reviewed or has verified, but it's not going to be
your primary responsibility.
You're going to be there to ensure that what is being written, what's being produced
is verifiable and good.
It's what we call the
human-in-the-loop interaction.
There's going to be agents, but that human is still going to be a central piece of that puzzle.
>> Yeah. They're becoming the supervisors, they're becoming the architects, they're becoming the managers.
They're the ones that are
ultimately accountable for whatever stage of the SDLC they're in, whatever they're building, but more of the deep technical work
in the coding and all that.

[22:31]
In other words, you need to
know how to build, in this case, software, but you don't
necessarily have to do it.
You're more supervising it with more and more help as time goes by.
I mean, I think that's the net of it.
>> Right. Like a general contractor instead of being a electrician.
>> Yeah. Well, it's certainly my view, and again, this goes
back to my predictions, and hopefully we will
see how those turn out, but I think you're basically
saying that this notion that the agents are going to be acting increasingly at a greater rate to help actually not
only build new solutions, but to maintain them, to test them.
And the human component is
going to be the specialists that know how to do all this.
And the goal is going to be
to not replace developers, which I think I'm not a big, I think all this AI replacing humans is, for most professions, is
not really going to happen.

[23:32]
It's going to give them
superpowers to do more and more and more, be more
creative, more innovative, higher productivity, so on and so forth.
And businesses will have
to make the decision.
Well, does that mean you can cut people or does that mean you can do
more and be more successful?
>> It's definitely the latter. We're going to see more productivity.
It's akin to when Photoshop
was first introduced.
It didn't get rid of any photographers.
It just made them much, much better.
>> Yeah. So looking ahead here, let's talk a little bit about not only where you see AI agents
 bridge the talent gap, but also what new career paths do you
think these AI agents are going to provide for anybody?
I'm just curious, because
I think my argument was, and the prediction was
software developers are going to become AI engineers, especially with the help of generative
AI and AI agents, and as agentic workflows kick in,

[24:32]
which is what we just talked about.
But I suspect that there's
going to be other people with different careers,
perhaps not even technical, that are going to be able
to get into this game.
>> Yeah, I'm really curious
to see what's going to happen with product-related folks
or product resources.
So product managers, product owners, UX/UI designers, et cetera.
Now they're no longer
dependent on a single engineer or a team of engineers to get prototypes and proven concepts out.
They'll be able to run through
ideas very, very quickly.
So we're going to see a very
interesting churn of ideas that go through and fast
failures, which is exactly what we want from the product side, to test out the market very, very quickly and then have now a full
engineering team build out those concepts into more production- level ready applications.
>> And one of the ways of
dealing with the gap here,

[25:33]
which I think we're
both definitely agreeing that is occurring and going to get worse, is you got to repurpose other skills.
And the secret sauce is going
to be a combination of, again, in my view, and I think you're
saying the same thing here, which is it's going to be a
combination of the technology through agentic AI, AI
agents with the ability to dynamically, flexibly and very quickly augment
skills from people like you, when you need them and help.
And I know from how I've
been working with you guys that you actually don't just
have hardcore technical people, but you have architects,
you have strategic managers, you've got a lot of
different kinds of skills that can very quickly augment a business and get them going as they build skills.
And so I think it's that combination of taking existing talent that
may not be an AI developer, evolving them into the
skill set with agents.
It's being flexible with the augmentation through outsourcing, and then it's going to be
obviously looking into the

[26:36]
marketplace, because
you're still going to want to have some core AI engineer deep skills, and that's where you're still going to have to fight that battle.
But businesses got to be
thinking holistically here.
>> Yeah. And that's exactly what we've done with our internal folks.
It's not just an engineering talent that we've trained with AI.
We've also trained UX/UI
designers, QA, DevOps, even project managers and scrum masters on AI agents, so that way they can see the
full SDLC, the full gamut and increase their skillset,
increase productivity.
So we're not just looking at
only at software engineers becoming AI engineers, we're
looking at every role within that life cycle and seeing how we can elevate their productivity.
>> Yeah, I mean, I've talked
to a lot of businesses, this is a side example, that are taking their
business analysts, what used to be business intelligence
people that use Cognos dashboards or Tableau or whatever, and they're actually using agents to try

[27:37]
to turn them into AI developers, which is, you would never think, if you
were a business analyst using Tableau, that you may end up being part of a development team, but
that's happening out there.
>> Yeah. And it's because they
have such a good grasp on data that they almost understand
what the AI will do.
Similar to how an engineer will understand what a compiler will do, based
off of certain instructions.
They have that intuitiveness, intuition to get that done.
>> Yeah, they're taking on the
data science elements of it, I guess, but that, today, is becoming AI.
So another example of
that hybrid profession.
So I'm going to dig a little
bit deeper into, especially for our audience, what you
guys are actually doing at BairesDev.
You have these internal tools, like the talent retention tool, you got team recommendation engine, and I know they've been
extremely successful.
They've cut attrition by what, 50% or so?

[28:38]
Can you walk us a little bit
through how these tools work and why they matter so much?
>> Yeah. The talent retention
tool, that was a brainchild, actually, we won the CIO
100 Award for that model.
All it does is takes an
employee's compensation history, skill sets, performance
metrics, et cetera, the full picture, and then
determines the risk of attrition.
What that allows us to do
is, based off of that risk, we could then be proactive and understand what we need
to do to retain that talent, whether it means a pay raise or an upskilling or even a change in a
project that has allowed us to retain upwards of 50% of existing attrition cases to make sure that we're being a little
bit more proactive in that.
Attrition is a costly
thing for any organization, and especially because it's
our business model, we want

[29:40]
to retain our as much as we can.
But for other companies,
when you risk attrition, you're essentially
risking domain knowledge, institution knowledge and the cost of onboarding
another engineer of that same caliber that
you've trained up over years.
>> Yeah. And I know, go
through the statistics here.
I know obviously your business
runs on having the best skills, and I know you guys have, what?
The top one or 2% of skill set out there, based on the amount of people
you hire versus applications.
Am I understanding that correctly?
>> Yeah, we have about 2
million applicants per year, and we hire only the
top 1% based off of what we're seeing in the market
and what the need is.
And so that allows us, one, to
attract the best of the best, but two, offer that kind
of talent to our clients, our 500 plus clients all over
the US, Canada, and Europe.

[30:43]
>> Yeah. So do you find
that the best of the best, they enjoy going from a different company, a different project?
I mean through you guys,
you're not doing one project, one company.
You get more diversity of experience, because you may be working
with multiple clients over some period of time?
>> Right. So what we found is
that our best engineers tend to stay at a single project or a single company for
as long as possible.
There might be some instances
that we've seen in that talent retention model where they might want a new challenge.
For example, if they're seeing
another skill that they want to develop, they want to
utilize that new skill in a different project, it
could be with the same client, it could be with a different client, and they'll ask for a change in their current workflow.
But for the most part, I'm
looking at some of our best, and they're staying at
our clients for upwards

[31:44]
of four years.
So these are not small
little two-month projects.
They're staying on for as long as they can because they love solving problems and they love being part of that of change or positive change for our clients.
>> That's awesome. Yeah,
that makes sense to me.
And I think becoming part
of that augmentation model, I just think it gives
people a lot of flexibility and a lot of experience.
And you stay on a project
for a long period of time, relatively speaking,
but you're not tied to, and I'm not talking about your company, I'm talking about your clients, because some people do more
than one client, correct?
>> No. So our main business
model is essentially if you augment with us,
you will have that person for as long as possible.
And there's no content switching.
There's no mind sharing,
no bait and switch.
That's essentially their
guy for as long as possible.
>> Right. And if they
do shut down a project

[32:45]
or whatever, then that person gets to go onto another project.
>> Exactly. Exactly.
>> Yeah. Yeah, I think it's
a great business model to be a part of, frankly,
what you guys are doing.
Obviously we're doing this podcast and I've expressed my view
that I think is a really critical part of where this
marketplace is going to head.
Actually, since we're
talking about your clients, could you maybe give
an example of a client, you don't necessarily have
to name them if you can't, but accelerated their AI initiatives by taking a different approach for talent acquisition or even retention?
>> Yeah, so we worked with a client in the legal space that
wanted to utilize AI as part of their product offering.
So essentially that team was an R&D team.
The internal client team was an R&D team, and we worked with them to,
number one, set up a number of proof of concepts to test out which GenAI model works best, which

[33:49]
problem they wanted to solve.
And then, based off of that
initial finding, I believe it was five proof of concepts,
they took one of them and then moved it into full production.
We were able to essentially
develop an application for them within four to six
months of just pure MVP, and it cut down their ...
this part, I can't fully say, but it cut down their
processing of time from about 21 hours for a single workflow to only a couple of minutes.
And that was purely AI-driven.
>> It's incredible. Let me just
bring up a a summary chart that I was going to show, assuming that we hit all the right points,
which I think we did, but I think this is the
bottom line, just want to get your thoughts on it.
So what it's basically saying here, and I've used this with several clients before, which people
seem to resonate with it.

[34:50]
With Deloitte as an example, businesses are focused on extending their workplace strategies because of AI, and in particular for AI.
And it nets out to, you got to
tap into on-demand AI talent.
That's what, I think, what you do.
Also outsource some or all the projects, which is something that you guys also do too.
So in other words, a big part of it, and obviously you need to really focus on creating
these hybrid professions where you're augmenting
existing skills that may or may not be an AI skill from its origin.
And by using these AI agents, and what you're basically
building out here is an interdisciplinary, an augmented
team of people and agents and outsources that have different skills.
It could be a very powerful
model versus just keeping, battling and battling in
this AI talent marketplace that has such a huge gap and you're going to be paying top dollar.

[35:51]
Is that a reasonable reflection of what you think landscape looks like?
>> Absolutely. It's not an
all or nothing type of deal.
You can utilize your existing
team members, you can augment with companies like us, and then you can also augment
additionally with AI agents.
And that collaboration between
all three allows you to, one, utilize your existing
institutional knowledge among your existing team members, but two, increase velocity
by adding on folks like us.
And then three, utilize new AI agents to help
increase velocity further.
So that three-pronged
approach is a killer move, and I wish more clients would do that or more companies would do that because then you go from zero
to 100 very, very quickly >> Yeah.
Posting AI jobs out on LinkedIn
or Indeed, and then going and fighting those battles
obviously needs to happen,

[36:51]
but you can't rely on it and you have to do all these other things.
>> I imagine that a company's
hiring process for, let's say, from the time they open up a
job rec on LinkedIn to the time that they get someone
butt in seat is anywhere between three to six months.
And a lot can change in the AI space within three to six months.
>> Right. And then like we were
saying before, you get them and then they get offered
an even higher paying job for something and the
retainment thing's tough.
Well look, so before we wrap
up here, if you had one piece of advice for any of the
executives that may be listening that are struggling with
AI talent, what would that piece of advice be?
And while you're at it,
what resources are available to learn more about what you guys do and how you can help them
navigate this wild west of AI talent and solution sourcing that is definitely starting to become a bigger and bigger deal in the market?
>> Yeah, I think for the execs
that are hiring AI talent, the biggest danger is
trying to find that unicorn

[37:51]
or that purple squirrel.
It's just not going to be found and you're competing with
everybody else trying to find that same person, if that person exists.
So utilizing a company like us
will help you get to that AI readiness level that you need to be at, but we could get that within
two to three weeks or less.
And we've proven that time and time again, and we already have the
capability, the resources, and the knowledge to get you into a place of actual development rather than just, let's call it ideation.
>> Yeah. It's going to be
fascinating to watch this and see how it shapes in the years ahead.
But look, I can go on
forever on this subject.
I do think it's one of the
most critical dialogues that the industry should be having, but we have to wrap up here.
But this has been incredibly insightful and a very helpful conversation.
I'm sure the audience
found it very valuable.

[38:51]
I don't think the message
can be any clearer that while AI may be that
transformative force, certainly of our era, it won't
go anywhere without the right talent strategy.
>> Absolutely.
- It just simply won't, yeah.
And technology alone is
not going to determine who wins in the different markets and the different industries.
That's going to be the people.
And you got to get out there and act and you don't want to lag, and you certainly don't want to fail.
And that's why it's time to
get really focused on this because again, all the evidence shows, and just in my conversations
with companies, that talent is thought about, but it's not a strategic imperative.
It's just sitting, like I said before, up in the stratosphere somewhere
and not getting the time and energy and investment that it needs.
And those that are being
successful are doing a lot of the things that we
talked about on this.
