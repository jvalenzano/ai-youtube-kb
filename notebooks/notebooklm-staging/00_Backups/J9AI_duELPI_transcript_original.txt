# 16. Governance and Compliance in the Age of Data & AI

**Video ID:** J9AI_duELPI
**Channel:** SiliconANGLE theCUBE
**Duration:** 38:47
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9AI_duELPI

**Module:** Foundations of AI Agents
**Module Rationale:** This video focuses on fundamental governance, compliance, and trust foundations that must be established before successful AI agent deployment, rather than specific workflows or tooling implementations

## Summary
- AI progress is hitting a wall due to trust, transparency, and compliance issues rather than technological limitations
- Only 38% of business users fully trust data/AI outputs today, projected to drop to 18% by 2030 without intervention
- Data generation will grow dramatically through 2030, but most enterprise data (95%) is not AI-ready for governance/compliance reasons
- Over 1,000 regulatory requirements span 69 countries, with 21% annual growth in AI-related regulations
- 69% of organizations are slowing AI initiatives due to trust, governance, and regulatory compliance concerns
- Four key challenge areas: identifying trusted data, scaling governed data enterprise-wide, creating explainable AI systems, and mitigating regulatory risks
- AI agents pose additional governance challenges as they move beyond prediction to autonomous decision-making and actions
- Organizations lack preparedness - only 2% feel very ready for AI governance, 0% use AI for compliance management
- AI presents dual nature as both cybersecurity threat and solution, requiring protection of AI infrastructure itself

## Key Takeaways
- **DO:** Start with data governance and classification before deploying AI - establish information architecture foundation
- **DO:** Use AI to help manage governance and compliance at scale given the volume of data and regulations
- **DO:** Design for global regulatory compliance requirements, as the lowest common denominator will prevail
- **DO:** Implement explainable and auditable AI systems, especially for agentic workflows that make autonomous decisions
- **DON'T:** Don't expect single vendors to solve all governance challenges - holistic approach requires multiple solutions
- **DON'T:** Don't deploy AI without proper data classification and governance frameworks in place

## Topics
AI governance, data compliance, regulatory landscape, AI agents, data classification, trust in AI, cybersecurity

## TL;DR
AI deployment is stalling due to governance and compliance gaps, not technology limitations.

## Full Transcript

>> Hello, Scott Hebner here.
I'm the principal analyst for
AI here at theCUBE Research.
Thank you for tuning it
into The Next Frontiers of AI podcast.
This is episode number 16.
Our goal's to partner
with industry pioneers to explore the latest developments
in the transformational world of AI with innovation
cycles moving at warp speed, staying up to date is
more important than ever, and we hope we're
helping you do just that.
Today, I'll be joined
by Christophe Bertrand, the principal analyst for
cyber-resiliency, data protection and data platforms here
at theCUBE Research.
Together, we'll unpack
a reality across the enterprise landscape.
AI progress is hitting a wall, not because of technology limitations, but because of trust, transparency
and compliance shortfalls.
While data-driven, AI-guided
decision-making promises to transform businesses in every industry, many organizations are now
pausing deployments due to inaccurate data governance
frameworks, rapidly-

[01:03]
evolving regulatory
landscape, more cyber-threats, a whole bunch of different issues.
Our research suggests that
there are four key challenges that enterprises need to tackle.
One is the need to identify and classify trusted data in
a much more effective way.
Two is they have to scale
governed data across the entire enterprise and all the functions
that need access to it.
They have to create
explainable, auditable AI and agentic systems that essentially open
up the AI black boxes and they have to mitigate risk
due to this ever-changing, ever-evolving global regulatory landscape that we're all living within today.
Our goal today is also to set the stage for an exciting summit that will be broadcasting on September 27th, 2025, theCUBE's Governance &
Compliance in the Age of Data & AI Summit.
And again, this will be on
September 27th, more on this as we go through the podcast.
So, with that, let me bring up Christophe.

[02:07]
Welcome to the podcast.
>> Hey, Scott. How are you?
Thank you for having me.
>> You bet. It's always good to see you.
We've been doing a lot of
talking and research together.
I think we're bringing our areas together, which I think is going to be exciting.
You have set the stage here for all of us by running such a successful summit, what was it back in January, right?
The Cyber Resiliency Summit?
>> Exactly. And we also run
research out of it as well as a follow-up item.
And well, surprisingly,
there may be some AI data points that we'll
discuss a little later today.
>> Yeah, what was it like 350,000 views, somewhere in that range? Very well- >> Yeah, we had lots of viewers.
I mean yourself got quite
a few, pretty much in that same range for the
Agenetic Summit as well.
So, yeah, we are getting a lot of eyes and it's great to run these summits.
More importantly, I think what
we do is we bring together

[03:07]
industry leaders, thought leaders and really present, for
the viewers, a 360 view of a specific topic.
So, that that's also, I think, what we'll be doing on
the September timeframe.
>> Yeah, and you mentioned
the AI Agent Builder Summit.
We're actually running
an encore production of that on June 25th, so I encourage everyone to go out and see that.
And Christophe, you have
another summit coming up next week too, don't you?
>> Absolutely. Yeah, exactly.
Data Protection & AI, and I
think we'll be talking about it at the summit together.
So, thank you in advance for joining us for an AnalystANGLE at the summit.
Yeah, I mean, again, everything
is about AI these days, but I think there's a lot of confusion and a lot of issues that
come up, as you suggested.
And more importantly, AI is
this multifaceted technology that is both your enemy,
your attacker in the context of cyber-resilience, can be
your friend as well as you

[04:10]
build it into your solutions
to be more automated, more productive, leading in time to more operationally-efficient
with agents.
At the same time, I think the AI infrastructure itself
needs to be protected.
So, you get two sides of the same coin.
And more importantly, you're
right, data and trust.
How do we trust what
we're getting out of this?
>> Yeah, after talking to probably 100 different
companies over the last six or seven months, and plus just
my experience at IBM when I was in their data and AI business unit, the advice you get from
everyone when it comes to AIs, it starts with your data.
It's the bloodline of AI.
There's no AI without an IA,
an information architecture.
And so, having the
governance and the compliance and the transparency and
the access to the data is more important, perhaps,
to get off to a good start with AI than just doing AI.

[05:12]
And so, I think what's great
about what we're doing here is that we're bringing our
research together, our thoughts, all the conversations we
have in the marketplace, and we're going to run that
summit on September 27th, that's going to bring it all together and I think it's going to be exciting.
But anyhow, we will get
into some of the things that we think are key here and would love to hear from everybody to help us shape the summit.
So, Christophe, let's start
with this research that we here at theCUBE
Research pulled together, which let me explain this chart
and get your thoughts on it.
The blue bars are showing
the estimated generation of new data from 2025 through 2030.
So, you can see it grows dramatically over that time period as we become
more and more data-driven.
The red line is a
projected amount of trust that business users and executives have in the
output they get from their data

[06:14]
and from their AI system.
So, today, only 38% fully trust what they're getting from data and AI.
And if we don't do
something differently here, it looks like it's projected
to go all the way down to 18% by 2030.
So, this is one of those
deals that say, I think we got to do something a little bit differently, otherwise we're going to
have a problem becoming data- driven, AI-guided.
Thoughts?
>> Well, a couple of things.
First of all, it said
zettabytes. That's a lot of data.
Let's start with that.
And that was just new
data you were showing.
So, a couple of points for our viewers.
I believe that a lot of
this data will be generated by AI itself.
There's already a lot of data
being naturally generated, a lot of IoT stuff, lots of stuff.
So, I think that's one aspect.
So, it immediately brings up
a question of how you're going to store all of that, which is something that will be exploring
and protect all of that.
I'll be exploring that
actually in my upcoming summit.

[07:15]
And believe it or not, we'll
talk about tape. Why not?
Because where do you think
that data is going to go?
But we'll talk about that later.
The other point is this is just new data.
So, this excludes the
existing zettabytes of data that are already in the infrastructure.
And what we know for sure, and again, I will have
more research in the future to demonstrate that a
lot of the actual data that is in existence
today isn't structured and it's not being classified.
So, okay, you want to do AI, that's great.
You need data that you can
trust, that means you need to know what is in the data
that you actually can use it, that it is correct, et cetera.
So, just looking at the
baseline data you have in your environment, do you even know
what you have and where it is?
Is it classified?
Do you have the right to even use it because of personal data, or PII depending on the
terminology you want to use,

[08:16]
depending on the compliance?
And that's just getting started.
And then, of course you may
start transforming the data, adding value to it through
a number of mechanisms.
Again, how is that governed?
And as you start looking at
this wave, this tsunami of data, no wonder that people
aren't going to trust that, the results.
And that's hoping that the AI
processes themselves, in time, agents do not hallucinate, do not create or destroy some valuable
data in the process.
So, that's why you said, "Yeah, the AI is sort hitting a wall.
" I mean it's not a wall,
it's a very, very, very wave that's going to destroy everything if
you don't pay attention.
And that's really what we are trying to explore in our various
summits between what you've done around agentic AI, what I'm
doing around cyber-resiliency, data protection and what we're going to do around governance and compliance.

[09:17]
I think there's a lot to
cover, but it is doable.
There is a method to the madness.
We'll share that in a minute.
>> Yeah, there's a ton
of pioneers out there delivering new solutions.
Some of the big guys are doing
a lot of interesting things, a lot of research and
development going on.
I think everyone knows that
this needs to get solved.
And we'll talk about
that a little bit later.
And you're right on the data layer because if you look at the AI that's predominantly in use
today, it is basically helping to create predictions and automate tasks, create
content, do all the things that we're familiar
with based on your data.
It basically uses past data
to help predict the future or to help automate repeatable tasks.
Where this gets more interesting
at the AI layer is when you start getting into a world
of agentic AI and AI agents because they're going to
do more than just predict.
They're supposed to make
judgments, help you make decisions, problem solving and even act autonomously.
And so, you just think about
the consequences of that.

[10:18]
You start to make
business-critical decisions, not just a productivity
tool like generative AI.
And so, the stakes are
going to go even higher.
And this is some more research that I uncovered is actually from Identity and SalesPoint, that 96% of people that are developing AI agents, they're worried about
the inability to audit and govern these agents, especially when they're
wired together into workflows and systems and how do you
maintain compliance controls?
And how do you ensure accountability to some human being if an agent's going to go off and do something?
What credentials do they
have and can you trace it?
And so there's a layer of data, there's an AI model layer, and then you've got this agent layer that's now coming on the scene here.
And I think Christophe, again,
this is going to get out of control soon if there's
not some real focus on addressing it from the get-go.
>> Yeah, exactly.
And I think you have to have
to know what data you have, you have to make sure it's usable

[11:19]
and then you're going to
have agents running around.
Agents, let's think about the term.
It's a term that's used
in legal frameworks, it's used in commercial frameworks.
An agent is a representative
of you or your organization.
And what you're describing is really how I would evaluate an employee.
So, an agent should be like an employee that implies access to certain things or not, certain behaviors, and of course a certain
type of performance.
And right now, I think what
we're seeing is very nascent.
We see some, mostly in the
SaaS world, organizations that are pivoting heavily
towards being agent-focused.
But it's funny, I was just
reading a post earlier that...
Well, maybe there's a lot of
rebranding, maybe some of those processes that are pretty
obtuse right now in order to get ROI, pretty limited,
may not be that efficient, especially in CRM type

[12:19]
of environments, but
it's going to get there.
I mean it's only a matter of time and it's going to go
faster than we'll think.
So, yeah, this I think compounds.
I think what you're
showing here, Scott, is we know we have a data issue,
no question about that.
We have a compliance issue
because of the data issue.
And now, we're going to have
an agent issue that's going to compound everything else in a process.
So, there are some things to fix and to pay attention to.
>> Then that gets you into another
challenge around all this, which is the regulatory landscape.
And I know here in the United
States a couple years ago, there's a guy, Mark Strauss
that works at Proof Analytics and he got me information on this.
In the state of Delaware,
there was a fiduciary law that corporate officers can no longer hide behind AI on why they did something, they're personally accountable.
And so, there's going to be
even a tops-down push to say,

[13:20]
"I got to understand why
this thing's doing it.
How sure we were not breaking
any policy or regulatory?
" And so, it's going to
get much more interest.
And I think you're pointing
out here is we're adding layers and layers to the challenge
that you got to get under.
And I know one of the
big parts of our summit and the September 27th is going
to be regulatory compliance.
This landscape is crazy.
So, I went out and just did
a little bit of research.
And there's over 1, 000 distinct regulatory regulations that span 69 countries.
So, if you are operating globally, that in itself is a challenge and it's growing 21% each year or at least in 2023 to 2024.
So, there's more and more
regulations that are coming up, not to mention the ones that are changing.
And just to give you some
information just in the United States as an example, at
the federal level in 2024,

[14:23]
a record number, 59 new
regulations were issued by various federal agencies
in 2024 related to AI.
That's pretty incredible. Then,
if you look at the states, they legislators in these states
have been debating 700 AI- related bills, resulting in 34 of the states actually
issuing new regulations.
Globally, 75 countries have mentioned AI in their
regulatory policy measures or legislature, which again, is bringing us to a global
environment makes it even more challenging.
So, we're going to have to really get underneath this on the 27th, Christophe.
>> Yeah, actually, it is very complex and people think, "Oh, it's GDPR and stuff like that,"
well, that's one aspect.
Now, you have AI being regulated.
And it's interesting because you hear a lot of
politicians fighting that, "Okay,

[15:25]
I want more regulation,"
or, "I want less regulation.
" Okay, pick your side, I don't care.
The net-net is this, you're operating globally, it doesn't matter.
You can deregulate all
you want in your state, even in your own country, even in the first economy
in the world, you're going to be bound by other country's regulations and that's going to be
what prevails, whether it's for compliance on data, very likely.
And also, for processes and
how you manage AI in general.
So, I think the problem
is of a global nature and maybe the lowest common
denominator is going to be what you have to really design for because at the end of the day,
if you're operating globally, that's what you're going
to have to work with.
>> And I know there's some in the so- called Big Beautiful Bill and all that stuff that they're
pushing, that they're trying to slow the states down on
having all these distinct regulatory for data and AI,
but if you just look at 34...
So, even if you're just
operating primarily in the United States, you've got to
deal state-by-state, so

[16:26]
I can only imagine how
complex it's going to be.
The other thing I
uncovered here was a survey by Compliance Insight, and so this is 2025 and so I summarized it here.
So, on the left-hand side it's saying, " How prepared is your organization to handle AI governance and compliance?
" And you can see only
2% said, "Very ready.
Very prepared." 36% said, "Somewhat.
" So, what does that get you,
38%? Zero actually... Yeah.
So, that's what that's saying.
On the right-hand side
then where it's saying, "Are you actually using
AI in your governance and compliance frameworks,
so you can manage all this?
" And I was blown away
to see that 0% said yes.
43% said they're actually
using AI in their organization, but they're not using it for
governance and compliance.
50% said outright no, 7% didn't know.

[17:28]
So, what this kind of is
saying, I think, Christophe, is that there's not a really good feeling that people are prepared for this.
Yet, at the same time,
they're not really using AI to help solve the problem.
And as we showed the growth
in data and all that stuff and the trust where we are already and all the regulations, how
do you solve this without actually applying AI to help you?
>> Exactly. So, that's kind of what I'm exploring too from
the perspective, the prism of data protection, data
resilience in my upcoming summit because that's exactly what I was saying with two sides of the same coin.
You have to manage and deal with AI as a
technology, workload, whatever you want to call it, because it's happening,
whether we like it or not.
Maybe a little slower now, but it's happening and it will continue.
At the same time you try
to make it your friend because to be able to scale, given the zettabytes you
identified in terms of new data, thousands of regulations
coming up, you have

[18:29]
to have some intelligence to help you.
So, I think that's where the
confusion, in my opinion, stands for a lot of people.
When you say AI and you're
talking say to an IT professional or even maybe an AI
professional, do you mean AI as in me using AI for my
business, in my business?
Is it me protecting my
AI investment from a data and process perspective or more like an expansion
of data protection?
Is it me making it resilient, so that it doesn't get
attacked by someone who may really try to take my business
down or inject some prompts or do whatever crazy stuff they might do?
Lots of confusion. So, I
think it's almost to the point where we need to coin new terms
for around AI or qualifiers because you can't just say AI in general, it doesn't mean anything anymore.
We're getting to that point
in the market where we need to be more specific, more
focused on the use cases,

[19:30]
more focused on establishing the baseline and the basics for success.
And you're right, no AI without IA, without an information architecture.
Well, what does that information
architecture look like?
What does it have to meet
as a set of requirements?
>> Yeah, again, the layers
are just being added here and think of the dimensions here.
So, automation has got to be
a part of the equation here.
And like you said, it
has to be intelligent, which kind gets you into using AI to actually help you manage
your entire state, govern it, get trustworthy data, make
sure your AI is compliant.
Because in the end, trust is the currency of innovation going forward here, I think.
And there's no trust, there's no ROI and it's something that people
really have to focus on.
And let's just do two more charts here on what's
happening in the marketplace.
Then, we'll jump to where we
think the focus needs to be and what frames the summit that we're going to be doing together.

[20:32]
So, the first one I'm
going to do here, which is this is a study by Bain & Company, which I found really interesting.
But if you look at the top
challenges when it comes to deploying AI across the organization, look at all the red bars.
Uncertainty around regulation, quality and accuracy, that's
largely about the data and about what the AI produces.
Data security and privacy concerns, intellectual property concerns.
They almost dominate
where the worry is about how do I deploy more and more AI?
And what's really happening here, 7 in 10, it was actually 69% are
slowing down new data and AI initiatives due to
the concerns about trust and governance and regulatory compliance.
Again, I think it's just another
proof point out there from this more from a business
perspective, that's the wall.
Maybe there's some doors
in that wall right now, but you can see it's
starting to have effect.

[21:35]
>> Yeah, I mean the data
is very clear from a great research that you sourced here.
What did it say? Regulations and essentially data-related topics and security, I noted was
number three, which goes back to a broader cyber-resiliency
posture you need to have for your whole organization,
so no surprises there.
And this is really why we're seeing, I think a convergence of markets.
And this is really more like
the industry analyst speaking here where the traditional storage, backup recovery folks are
getting more into data specification, have to, and are integrating
cyber-resiliency, cybersecurity type of features, and are more
heavily now committed to data management because without this sort
of infrastructure in place, you can't really go do anything
intelligent with the data, which AI would fall in that category.
And that's before we
talk about anything else around AI being managed itself.

[22:35]
So, I think this is a very interesting.
And by the way, I also noted
executive support was actually the last one on the list.
So, executives are onboard, they're not sure about the ROI yet.
That was one of the points.
But a big issue is the organizations, the companies are already
with data and compliance.
>> Yeah. Risk, right?
It's that whole risk versus
innovation trade off, and I think everyone's
struggling with that.
The other part of the risk though, and you've done some
really great research.
Let me bring up one of the slides from it and maybe you can talk a little bit about what this is saying.
What did you find here?
>> Yeah, so we serve at actually
600 people around the world as part of a cyber-resiliency research, which is very comprehensive
following the NIST 2 model.
And we also typically ask questions about general sentiment on what's
coming up in the next 12-

[23:39]
18 months, which is what
this question was about here.
And we asked them, "Okay,
what are your major concerns for the next 12-18 months and
what do we see cloud security?
" So, already security is a top one.
And number two, AI-driven
cyber-attacks right behind.
And this was a popularity contest or I guess pick your
poison type of question, but I think it's very, very clear.
You can see by the way
what I was saying earlier, which is extremely consistent
with your research, it's about risk, it's about AI being part of the issue and it's about data.
And I note that regulatory compliance
makes a very nice showing in number five here.
And by the way, I think
when you have encryption or exfiltration, you are in the space of missing your regulatory requirements.
So, again, different answers
are possible, people picked the most popular topics for them, but it tells us where the market's at.

[24:40]
600 people around the world,
that's the reality of today.
That's where a lot of the people viewing this
podcast are probably thinking is happening in their own organization.
>> Yeah, what is that U2
song? "Every City has its good and has its bad.
" I think the name of the song is Bad.
It goes back to what you were saying before is AI can be
both a friend and a foe.
So, the foe part I think
jumps out on that chart is that people can actually
use AI against you and you got to be thinking about that.
And you're the expert
in that space that you and I haven't thought a lot about or researched around how AI is going to change the threat landscape, but I would imagine it's pretty dramatic.
>> Yeah, it's already happening and it's happening in many ways.
Actually, I don't want
to divulge anything yet, but I know I'm going to be
having a great conversation with a speaker who will tell
us a little bit about what AI can actually do to deceive you and how to protect against that.

[25:41]
So, stay tuned. That's
coming up in the next summit.
>> I'll be watching. All right.
So, let's get into this chain link, as I think we were calling
it here, of the things that we think need to become a big focus.
And there's probably a hell
of a lot more than four, but Christophe, I think it's fair to say we think these
are the four big ones.
This is what we're going to
orient the summit on September 27th around.
And it's anchored in this
high-level notion that 95% of enterprise data is not
AI-ready, it's not ready to be used in AI for a bunch
of reasons around governance and compliance and privacy.
And 90% of the actual AI that's
being put into production is that not fully-compliant.
Big problem. So, these are
the four big focus areas.
Christophe, you are on the left-hand side.
I'm on the right-hand side.
Why don't you just talk
about the two on the left?

[26:43]
>> Yes. So, first of
all, as I was mentioning and you were too, I mean
there's a ton of data and most organizations recognize that they don't really even know
how much data they have and where it is.
And there's so much
that they have to manage or not manage that the real challenge, the first challenge is to really identify and classify all of your data.
That means really
understanding everything, not just the structured data and databases or whatever the case may
be, that's kind of easy.
I shouldn't say that, but it is easier.
When you look at unstructured,
which is the vast majority of data these days, that
becomes more complex.
Then, you get into
semi-structured, which is what most applications are.
There's a database
somewhere, powering a bunch of objects and documents
and what have you.
And a lot of it could be really out of your control from an
engineering and design standpoint because it's a SaaS service, but you're still responsible for that.
So, data is the first step.

[27:46]
And let me tell you, it's very basic.
If you don't know 100% of your
data, you don't control it, you don't own it, you don't classify it, you don't make it compliant.
First of all, you're introducing
significant business risk.
You're not compliant, that
means you could lose money.
You're probably not very
operationally efficient and there's no way you're going
to be able to do AI safely.
Now, I say this. There are some parts or processes that you may be okay with, especially when it's things like...
And that's why what we're
seeing in the first use cases, tech support, knowledge bulletins.
You're not going to have
PII in that necessarily.
It's a lot safer. But
there's always a risk maybe of divulging some trade
secrets in the process.
So, you never really know until you know.
So, understanding that for
compliance, understanding it for governance and for privacy and for security of your business, that's the starting point.
And then, you can get into
the other phases, which is to govern the access to
the data, whether it's for individuals or agents
as a matter of fact.

[28:48]
And again, some SaaS vendors
are already all in on trying to do that now.
A lot of it's marketing
in my opinion right now, and I think the efficiency and the results are
probably lagging behind, but in time, it will get really good.
It's not a question. I'm not
doubting that for a second.
It's just not quite there yet then.
So, yes, so you think about that.
I would argue honestly across
all of these dimensions, we couldn't even draw an arrow
that says, "Business risk.
" Really, it's existential risk because you need to be compliant and you need to be using AI if you want to survive in this world in time.
So, I think for a lot of enterprises it's going to be a big challenge.
And I like these four categories, if you don't mind showing them again, because I think it allows us to really go

[29:48]
talk about specific topics that under each of these come a bunch of
technologies and vendors.
Some of them are across a couple of them.
Nobody can do it all.
So, as an end user, if you're
thinking or strategist in IT or data, you're thinking about,
"What do I need to go get?
" Well, you're going to need all of this.
Not one vendor will give it to you.
And you're going to have to
really think about the use cases that make the most sense
because I do believe and we'll see what we hear, but I do believe that you
can actually go across all of these dimensions, but now
it's going to be very limited.
It's going to be by
maybe business process, not across the board holistically.
Anyway, it's just my take.
But we will be discussing
these topics in our summit.
>> What I like about this is
a holistic view that says, "These are really key priorities.
There's a lot more you
have to worry about, but these are the key ones.
And if you can start to solve these, the other things are
going to become easier.
" And I like the idea of

[30:51]
talking about the considerations,
the best practices that are emerging, the solutions
that vendors are bringing to bear, what real
businesses are doing in each one of these circles.
And you talked about the two
on the left, if you're able to accomplish a good amount of progress and higher-quality data,
governed, you feel trusted, use of it across the organization,
that's going to go a long way to getting your AI to be more trusted, but that's only part of
the trust issue with AI.
I think the other part
is today these things are black boxes.
They just don't have the transparency and the auditability of how they come up with recommendations and decisions.
And it's one thing to make a
prediction, it's another thing to make a judgment or to make a decision, which these agents are supposed to do.
Those black boxes have to be opened up.
And a lot of the solutions
today are really just predicting what they think is happening,
they don't really know.
So, explainability, understandability and transparency of how these agents

[31:52]
and AI models operate will
become increasingly important.
And there are solutions
coming onboard to the market, and we're going to talk about that.
And then, so you get the
data to a trusted level or least a more trusted level
year AI to more trusted level.
Then, the challenge,
Christophe, where is true for both the data layer and the AI layer is all this regulatory stuff we
were talking about earlier.
And that's going to be an ongoing sport.
That game doesn't end because
they're always changing.
There's always new ones coming onboard, and I think it's going to be
a fascinating conversation.
We'll have experts in
each one of those circles.
And that's what I love about
bringing everything together because you've talked to hundreds and hundreds of people within your scope, and I've done it on my scope on the AI, and we're going to bring all this together into a think-tank.
I think it's going to be great.
>> And I think another thing
that will likely happen, we're starting to see
this already happening around cyber resiliency
with this combination of different markets from
traditional security to

[32:55]
really colliding or combining
with IT, for example, and other dimensions
around data management.
Those teams are starting to collaborate and work together a little better.
I think that here the same
thing will be happening.
We're probably going to
find some disconnects, but also, opportunities for
organizations to morph in how they approach this
notion of compliance, data serving a business process
or a business outcome.
So, this is the beginning.
I'm sure we're going to be
talking about this for many, many years to come, but
it's also a turning point and it's a turning point because of the data that's at stake here, because of the regulations and
because of the amount of data and the business pressures we're under.
So, we'll see, but I believe that in
the next couple of years we will start discerning
some winners in some of these areas on the
left-hand side and in my area.
And I do believe you already
have some interesting players

[33:57]
on the right-hand side in
your area of the business.
>> Yeah, absolutely.
- So, we'll see what happens.
And of course what we'd like
to do with this summit is let's go do a little research,
let's go talk to people.
And as we gather all of
this intelligence, all of these perspectives, this
360 view, where's the state of data governance,
data compliance and AI?
Where are people, actually?
Where are you, the viewers?
And that's what we'll
try to get to a few weeks after the event.
>> Yeah, to help give us
insights and guidance for 2026.
So, before we run out of
time here, Christophe, why don't you give us a little
bit of a brief overview?
I think we've talked a good
amount about the summit, but how's it going to be structured?
It's September 27th.
>> Yes. So, typically, what
we do with these summits, we will have a live
presentation, live show with all the experts that
we'll bring around the table, vendors, end users.

[35:00]
We've started the conversation, so we don't have the final list yet.
It will take a little bit of time.
And the idea's that we going
to explore multiple topics around governance and compliance in AI, and looking at it from multiple prisms and also providing our perspectives.
Certainly, both of us as
analysts, we may bring a couple of friends from our
analyst community as well and from theCUBE Research to two-way in and give us their perspective.
But I think what we're
going to get is this idea that we want to get a
360 view out of the topic in 2025 of best practices of leading companies that
participate in the summit because they believe it's important.
They believe they have the great solutions to support their customers.
And really, the truth is
we want to surround that with market research to really keep the conversation going in 2026 in the following months.

[36:02]
And by the way, all of our
summits, they're on-demand.
So, you can go look at, of course yours, the Agentic AI Summit, the Cyber Resiliency Summit,
they're all available.
So, you can get a chance to see how we approach these topics.
And it's typically very comprehensive.
I can promise you, when we have vendors, they're really friends
and experts, many of them, we've known them for a long time.
They're not pitching a solution.
They're really explaining how
they can help with technology, what they're seeing in the market.
So, don't think this is a big
webinar with vendors pitching.
No, it's really a thorough
double-click on a number of topics around these
themes that we cover and I think they've been so well-received.
I mean hundreds of thousands
of views, so thank you to our viewers and please keep coming.
We love it and we love your feedback.
>> Yeah, to check one of
these out, go see the ones that we've mentioned, go to thecube.
net and go under past or on-demand.
And for the ones that
are going on next week,

[37:03]
that would be the week
of June 24th, I think- >> That's going to be the 30th,
July 1st when we're running the Data Protection & AI Summit.
>> Right. And the encore of the AI Agent Builder
Summit is on June 25th.
But as we go through the summer, you'll be hearing a lot
more about the one that we're talking about
here for September 27th, so stay tuned for that.
And if you're a vendor
or a solution provider or service provider in
this space, contact us for sponsorship opportunities
and to participate.
We would love to have you. All right.
Well, Christophe, I think
it is time for us to go.
I know you have to go, for sure.
We can go on for hours and
hours on this I'm sure, but I guess we'll have plenty
of time to do that when we get to the summit in September.
I really appreciate it, Christophe.
Thanks so much for joining us.
>> Thank you for having me.
- You bet.
