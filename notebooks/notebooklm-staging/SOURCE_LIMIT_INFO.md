# NotebookLM Source Limits - Important!

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DISCOVERY

You've hit NotebookLM's **source limit**!

### Limits Found:

1. **File Size Limit**: 200 MB per source file (your images are fine - all under 1MB)
2. **Source Count Limit**: **50 sources per notebook** (FREE PLAN)
3. **Your Content**: 
   - 27 transcripts
   - 119 slide images  
   - 119 companion files (optional)
   - 1 Master Knowledge Base
   - **Total: 266 sources** (if all uploaded)

## The Problem

You've exceeded the **50 source limit** on the free plan. This is why:
- Some images uploaded initially (before hitting the limit)
- New uploads fail even individually (limit already reached)
- NotebookLM stops accepting new sources once limit is hit

## Solutions

### Option 1: Upgrade to Paid Plan (Recommended)

**Google One Premium** or **Workspace** plans may have higher limits:
- Check your account type
- Consider upgrading if you need all sources
- Contact NotebookLM support to confirm limits on paid plans

### Option 2: Create Multiple Notebooks

Split your content across multiple notebooks:

**Notebook 1: Core Content** (50 sources max)
- Master Knowledge Base (1)
- All 27 transcripts (27)
- Top 22 most important slide images (22)
- **Total: 50 sources**

**Notebook 2: Additional Slides** (50 sources max)
- Remaining slide images
- Companion files (optional)

**Notebook 3: More Content** (if needed)
- Additional slides/images
- More companion files

### Option 3: Combine Images into Documents

Instead of uploading 119 individual images, create PDF documents:
- Group related slides into PDFs (e.g., 10-15 slides per PDF)
- Upload PDFs instead of individual PNGs
- Reduces source count significantly

**Example**: 119 images → 8-12 PDF documents = 8-12 sources instead of 119

### Option 4: Prioritize Essential Content

Upload only the most important sources:
- All transcripts (27) - essential
- Master Knowledge Base (1) - essential  
- Top 22 slide images (22) - most important ones
- **Total: 50 sources**

## Recommended Approach

**Best Strategy**: Create **2-3 focused notebooks**

1. **Notebook 1: "AI Agents - Core Learning"** (50 sources)
   - Master Knowledge Base
   - All 27 transcripts
   - 22 most important slide images

2. **Notebook 2: "AI Agents - Visual Reference"** (50 sources)
   - Remaining slide images
   - Companion metadata files

3. **Notebook 3: "AI Agents - Extended Content"** (if needed)
   - Additional slides
   - More companion files

## How to Check Your Current Source Count

In NotebookLM:
1. Look at the Sources sidebar
2. Count the number of sources listed
3. If it shows 50, you've hit the limit

## Next Steps

1. **Check your current source count** in NotebookLM
2. **Decide on strategy**:
   - Upgrade plan (if available)
   - Create multiple notebooks
   - Combine images into PDFs
   - Prioritize essential content
3. **Remove some sources** if you want to add different ones
4. **Contact NotebookLM support** for clarification on paid plan limits
