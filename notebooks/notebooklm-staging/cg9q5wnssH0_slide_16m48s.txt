**Before:** over time, I think gets further enhanced by say better and better reasoning capabilities that are starting to show up in the marketplace. Chain of thought is one of them,
**After:** but I think this is going to go much further than that. This is another good chart that I came up with here and it compares the notion of semantic reasoning and causal reasoning.
