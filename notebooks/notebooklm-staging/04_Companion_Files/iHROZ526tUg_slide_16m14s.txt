## Transcript Context
**Before:** through time here, as they get democratized by different vendors in the marketplace. Let's translate that into the world of agents. I've pulled a chart together here
**During:** that basically outlines the tiers of sophistication,
**After:** very high level obviously. But if you think of a domain intelligence agent that understands the specific domain, like legal precedent when doing contracts, it acts based on
