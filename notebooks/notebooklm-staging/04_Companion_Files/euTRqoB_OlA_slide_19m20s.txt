## Transcript Context
**Before:** to understand the goal you're trying to achieve and help you problem solve, and I think that's where this stuff, my two cents is that's where it's headed in the years ahead.
**After:** I want to get your view on this diagram here, where I think we're at the chain of thought layer now, which is a step on that ladder, if you will, to more and more capable reasoning
