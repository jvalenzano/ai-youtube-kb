## Transcript Context
**Before:** that I wanted to touch on a little bit with you, one that think over time will be the big differentiating components, if you will. One is the agentic RAG, which is coming on the scene now,
**During:** and then the other is going to be the reasoning.
**After:** There's a little chart that I found out on the internet that compares a standalone LLM, traditional RAG and then agentic RAG.
