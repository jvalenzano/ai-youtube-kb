## Transcript Context
**Before:** and you start over time infusing the semantics and the causal stuff into it, the reasoning, super powerful compared to what you're able to do with a generative AI, task-oriented chatbot today
**During:** or assistant, which brings us to
**After:** these levels of sophistication in terms of the type of agents that you can start to think about when you are building an agentic system or an architecture.
