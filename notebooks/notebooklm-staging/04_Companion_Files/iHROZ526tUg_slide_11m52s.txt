## Transcript Context
**Before:** actually make trustworthy decisions from an AI point of view. All right. Let's just dive a little bit deeper into these technologies, just to give you a little bit
**During:** of insight into how this comes to life.
**After:** Again, this is what I've pieced together all the conversations I've had. When you think about these decision intelligence type of technologies, I think  number one,
