# 11. Agentic AI Architecture Matters

**Video ID:** cg9q5wnssH0
**Channel:** SiliconANGLE theCUBE
**Duration:** 40:14
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg9q5wnssH0

**Module:** Foundations of AI Agents
**Module Rationale:** This video focuses primarily on the foundational technologies, architectural principles, and core concepts needed to understand and build agentic AI systems

## Summary
- Agentic AI represents a fundamental shift from AI assistants to digital workers that can plan, think, and make decisions autonomously
- Architecture matters more than ever - agentic systems require integration of multiple technologies including LLMs, vector databases, knowledge graphs, and multi-agent communication protocols
- Salesforce is positioned well for agentic AI due to their integrated data cloud, Customer 360, and systems architecture that provides unified business state
- Agentic RAG is a major advancement over traditional RAG, enabling dynamic planning, reflection, and tool invocation rather than hard-coded retrieval
- Reasoning capabilities are evolving from semantic understanding to causal reasoning, enabling agents to understand cause-and-effect relationships for better decision making
- Four levels of agent sophistication: task execution, domain-specific knowledge, reasoning/decision making, and orchestration/planning across multi-agent systems
- A harmonization layer or 'cognitive core' is essential for coordinating multiple agents and maintaining shared business state
- Most enterprises should start with agents built into existing platforms rather than building from scratch, then gradually expand capabilities
- The shift requires treating AI officers as HR managers for digital workers, fundamentally changing how we think about workforce management

## Key Takeaways
- **DO:** Start with agents built into existing enterprise platforms (Salesforce, Oracle, SAP) rather than building from scratch
- **DO:** Focus on integrated systems approaches rather than isolated agent deployments to ensure proper data foundation and coordination
- **DO:** Invest in knowledge graphs and semantic layers to enable more sophisticated reasoning and decision-making capabilities
- **DON'T:** Don't think of agentic AI as just advanced chatbots - it requires rethinking software architecture from the ground up
- **DON'T:** Don't attempt complex multi-agent systems without proper harmonization layers for coordination and shared state management

## TL;DR
Agentic AI requires integrated architectural thinking beyond LLMs to create coordinated digital workers.

## Full Transcript

>> Hello.
Welcome back to The Next Frontiers of AI, a podcast dedicated to
exploring the insights, best practices and real-world experiences of those shaping the future of AI.
And that future may be
here sooner than you think.
As innovation cycles continue
to move at warp speed, it has never been more
important to stay informed, and we hope we are helping you stay one step ahead of the crowd.
I'm Scott Hebner, your host,
and thank you for tuning in.
Today we continue our discussions on how to turn agentic AI
aspirations into outcomes.
Last week, we discussed why
it's never been a better time to be a startup or to start a
new business using agentic AI, or as a company, to use it to
automate how work gets done.
The nature of agentic AI has
totally reset what is possible.
AI is no longer about assisting
people in executing tasks.

[01:00]
It's about helping people
get actual work done, knowledge work, planning, thinking, making decisions, problem solving.
We learned three key success
factors from how Haoyu Zha, the CEO of a highly successful
agentic AI startup named HOAi last week.
He said, "Go deeply vertical,
rethink what software is and target labor spend, not IT spend.
It's all about digital coworkers, not just digital assistants.
The focus is on domain
specific digital labor.
" I thought it was excellent
advice from a proven winner in the new agentic AI marketplace.
Today we take the next step with the help of an accomplished technologist and industry analyst in the
AI space, George Gilbert.
We'll delve into how AI agents
are reshaping enterprise workflows, the technologies
that enable them and why this marks a fundamental shift in how software is designed,
deployed, and involved.

[02:02]
Why architecture matters
is what we're really going to focus on here because it's
more important than ever.
George is the principle analyst
here at theCUBE Research.
I'm sure many of you know him already.
He focuses on data
platforms, intelligent apps, and agentic frameworks.
And just last week in fact,
he interviewed Marc Benioff, the founder and CEO of
Salesforce on how software and labor markets will never
be the same going forward because of the rise of agentic AI.
If you haven't watched it, make sure you check it out
either on the AI Agent Builder Summit portal or go directly to YouTube and you'll be able to watch it.
It's a fascinating conversation.
All right, so let's get started here.
I'm thrilled to have George
Gilbert. There he is.
I brought him up. How you doing, George?
>> Hey, Scott. Good.
- Weather good in California, I hope?
>> It is. We're seeing the
first parts of spring, at least after we hunker down for the rainy season.
>> Yeah, it's finally 75
degrees here outside New York.

[03:06]
>> Oh, wow. No, we're way behind that.
>> All right, let's dive into this.
The thing that I'm most
curious, let's start with your takeaways after talking to Marc Benioff, which was just an absolutely
fantastic interview.
What did you learn? How
does his views differ from what you've heard from dozens of other companies that
you've engaged with?
>> My biggest takeaway and the source of my interest
in Salesforce is that agents are like a shiny object to everyone because it's a radically new technology that's transformative both
on how we consume software and how we build software, but I think what's not part
of the conversation always is that it's a systems problem, and that means that the performance of the
agents is only as good as the data about the state of the business on which
they're based, that they use

[04:07]
for inference and their ability to operationalize their decisions.
And that's why I thought,
so far of the incumbent, Salesforce is farthest ahead because with their data
cloud system of intelligence, agent Salesforce system of agency and Customer 360 as
their systems of record.
It's all integrated into one piece.
The customers still have
to clean up their data, but you've got an all-in-one system that makes it much easier to
get live than a do-it-yourself that only tech companies are capable of.
>> Yeah, I mean, it was super interesting.
He definitely has a vision
for where this is all heading.
I like his statement about
how he may be the last CEO to be managing just human employees.
I thought that was a really
interesting point of view.
>> One last thing that he mentioned that I thought was a
great example was Disney.
You can be walking through a theme park and your experiences is impacted by the lines and you don't know...

[05:09]
You have to make either
reservations or wait in long lines.
And the one thing that I
thought was interesting, he talked about an example
where everyone in the park could have their own agent.
I'm not sure whether
this was live already, and the agent would be,
based on their preference, booking them rides based
on the length of the lines, like optimizing the experience based on preference and availability.
And that meant there were
thousands of agents going around doing this for different
people simultaneously.
And that, you can't do
if you're thinking about just a single agent.
>> Yeah, it's like little tour
guides helping the people have a better experience and- >> Exactly.
>>  going on.
When he made that
statement, it reminded me of what Abdi Goodarzi, the head
of generative AI at Deloitte, said during the AI Agent Builder
Summit, that he's starting to see their clients
treating the chief AI officer as not obviously a technologist
but also a business person,

[06:11]
but also as an HR person and responsible for managing
the HR of digital workers.
>> Onboarding digital workers. Yeah.
>> Fascinating stuff.
- Yeah.
I've heard of... Jensen
Monk talks about that.
IT department being now
the HR for digital labor, but the chief AI officer within that, it's probably even more accurate.
>> Yeah. Well, look, one
of the things that you and I have talked a lot about is how agentic AI is truly a change from what we've been doing
over the last three years with generative AI and AI
assistants executing tasks and analyzing information and things of that nature, which everyone is pretty
much familiar with.
This is a whole new ballgame
that we're entering here, and I think that's why
people like Marc Benioff and others are so excited about it.
It's going to take a
lot of new technologies that are emerging on the scene beyond just

[07:12]
LLMs and generative AI.
And one of the things I did,
let me just bring this up so you can see it here and the audience can see
it, is this is the aggregate of several surveys on the right, on what are the most important
new technologies that are going to be needed to build
these agentic workflows as time goes by here.
And what is there? Seven
of them or so here?
I mean, gen AI and LLMs is obvious, very high relevancy, the highest buy most of the rankings here.
It's the foundation. But we
get into things like vector databases and agentic RAG, and these multi-agent
communication protocols, and you need tool APIs, and you get into decision
intelligence and learning loops.
This is a lot of new stuff that people are going to
have to figure out, right?
What's your view on this?
It seems like there's a lot to work with.
There's a lot you need to deal with now.
>> Well, it's like when you put
Gen AI or the LLM at the top.

[08:14]
That's just the thing that's
responsible for essentially coming up with the control
flow of a new application or a component of a new application, but you needed all those other components.
The vector database was at least for embeddings when you want to search and feed in chunks from
your knowledge base.
And that's itself just a first step because that's like a fuzzy search.
So as you were talking
about, if you want semantic and causal reasoning, you
actually need structured data beyond what's in the vector database.
You need the knowledge graph
to show what's linked to what.
An agentic RAG is like you might traverse the knowledge graph,
look up some information, reflect on it, find
you're missing something, and then make an additional
plan and invoke some tools.
And that's so part of agentic RAG.

[09:16]
>> This is like it builds from top to bottom in some ways, right?
You get the foundation of GEN.
AI and LLM Foundation, then they're going to execute better and be more efficient with the vector databases versus the old relational and data warehouses.
You got to do a lot of
work with your data.
And then, like you said, you get into RAG and then you got to get these
things to talk to each other and integrate with tools and ultimately make decisions
and the whole thing learns.
There was a lot of technologies mentioned, but these are the ones
that have high relevancy, and that's a lot of technologies for sure.
>> It goes back to the point,
right now, the way you have to integrate all these
pieces, you either need to be a very sophisticated shop or you need to buy from
someone who's done the integration for you.
So the tech-centric born-in-the- cloud companies might have
this chops to do this, but most Fortune 500,
Fortune 1000s do not.

[10:19]
>> Right. And that's fueling
this 47% compounded growth in agentic systems and agentic platforms.
Let these companies help
you build that foundation, then you focus on your
added value on top of it.
That's where I think these
technologies are going to start to show up.
And I think we both agree as we talked before the podcast about
architecture really matters, right?
>> Yeah.
- You've got to really think about this.
I mean, this is the ultimate
team sport in terms of how different technologies and different parts of an organization and different parts of your
data set have to work together.
And just like the theme park
example you gave, that's not as simple as just rolling out a generative AI to somebody, right?
>> Yeah. When you say
architecture matters, that's back to the systems approach.
It's like you don't build a complex enterprise application because
you wrote one microservice.
There's a lot more to it.

[11:20]
And agents, it's a little oversimplifying to say they're microservices that think, but they got to be part
of a larger system.
>> Yeah, absolutely. I think that's a good way of thinking about it.
It's a componentized architecture and these microservices now
represent little workers that collaborate with each other and with humans to get stuff done.
Really does change the ballgame and it also changes the
nature of software in general, which is what the advice was
last week was don't think about building how you would go
about building a SaaS app.
This is a totally new thing, right?
>> Right. Right.
- So let's dive...
There's two particular
areas of those technologies that I wanted to touch on a
little bit with you, one that think over time will be
the big differentiating components, if you will.
One is the agentic RAG, which
is coming on the scene now, and then the other is
going to be the reasoning.
There's a little chart that
I found out on the internet

[12:22]
that compares a standalone
LLM, traditional RAG and then agentic RAG.
What's your view of this whole thing that is getting a lot of focus now?
I mean, like you were saying before, it's able to navigate through a knowledge
graph more effectively.
It's able to do a lot of things that traditional RAG cannot do, right?
>> You think of it like an LLM has no external context or data.
It's just you're asking it questions about what's in the weights.
The traditional RAG would
be like naively chunked vector embeddings, and that's essentially the extent of its tool use is
invoking the vector database and you maybe have a re-ranker
to say what you pull out of the vector database, tell
me what's most relevant first.
But the agentic RAG then
it adds so much more because, as the name
implies, it can make a plan,

[13:24]
it can retrieve data, reflect on what it's retrieved, decide
does it have all the information it needs, or based on what
it's retrieved, figure out what additional steps it needs to do to find more information,
invoke other tools.
I mean, it's a huge leap forward in utility and the outcomes you can achieve.
>> Yeah, I think that was the
notion if you were looking carefully at the traditional
RAG versus the agentic RAG is exactly what you just
said, the way I just read what you said, which
it's much more dynamic.
It can then choose what
to do because planning and it can integrate with
more tools on the fly.
You don't have to hard code
it all or structure it, right?
It's a much more real-time
dynamic decision on what to invoke and what to pull in terms of what's relevant. I mean, I think that's- >> Just the way you were saying.
The key word was to what
you said, the hard-coded because you're moving from putting...

[14:26]
All the control flow is
in symbolic code to more and more is dynamically planned and generated by the agent, more and more of the control
flow of the application, or in this case, this
particular task is generated and executed by the agent.
>> Yeah, and I think it
goes back to your point before about the
do-it-yourself versus acquiring and building on a platform because these are the kind of technologies that I could chance to
grab that will become part of those platforms, right?
>> Right.
- In the tool set.
>> Yeah, if you look at Microsoft's 365, they have the Microsoft graph as a way of organizing all the information
from your productivity and collaboration applications so that when you can reason over
it, if someone says, "I want to look at the project plan
of a particular project, " it knows how to find
everything that's related because it's spelled out
explicitly in this graph.

[15:31]
And in the case of Salesforce, their data cloud is going to have...
It has unstructured information now, but they're going to turn
that into a knowledge graph, again, so that you can traverse
the information much more explicitly, not the fuzzy
search of an embedding alone.
That's the downside of the...
I'm having a senior moment here.
I did  in my defense.
When you just have a vector
database, it's the equivalent of doing a vector search, but that works best when
you can complement it with a knowledge graph for the precision.
One is explorer, the other exploit.
>> Yeah, and it gives the agent the RAG, the retrieval capabilities that better understand the context.
They're able to understand relationships among different things
better. They're able to- >> Right.
explicitly.
>> Yeah, yeah. Aligned to some goal.
So a really important
foundational technology, which,

[16:33]
over time, I think gets
further enhanced by say better and better reasoning capabilities that are starting to show
up in the marketplace.
Chain of thought is one of them, but I think this is going to
go much further than that.
This is another good chart
that I came up with here and it compares the notion of semantic reasoning
and causal reasoning.
So semantic reasoning, as I understand it in the research I've
done is, like you said, it's based on knowledge graphs
and it's able to help...
Think about infusing this
within the context of the RAG, the agentic RAG that we just talked about, but it understands a little bit more about intent and context.
It's going to fetch more
contextually aware data.
It understands and shares
semantic understanding within an agent and the
different things it needs to deal with from a data perspective,
but also among agents.

[17:34]
It's just all about
perception and coherence and understanding meaning of things.
That is the science of
how AI is being applied around the knowledge graph.
The next step on that is what
call a causal knowledge graph, which does all the same things.
Think of it as if semantic
reasoning is a high school, not a high school, but a master's degree.
Causal reasoning is the PhD.
It's the next level of sophistication that not only understands
context and relationships and all that, but it actually understands the causal effects, the
causal logic of what invokes what based on what.
So all the dependencies become more cause and effect-oriented, which
is what really allows you to make judgments because
a judgment is a function of understanding cause and effect and you need judgments to make decisions.
And so it takes it to a whole
new level of sophistication

[18:35]
and it's really just a knowledge graph that actually has causality or causal links between the entities.
So what are your thoughts on
this? I know we may be a couple years ahead of the curve here
in terms of adoption rates, but I think you're going
to see a lot of action on that left-hand side of this chart that will actually grow over
time into the right-hand side.
>> I think you're 100% right.
I think this is part of a
larger movement, which is as more and more knowledge of how the business work is
learned by your data systems, basically you've always
been setting up analytics to answer the most basic
questions about the business, which is what happened.
But the next set of
questions is around why, why did something happen?
Then it's what's likely to happen and what should we do?
And the reason I put that as
part of the framework is today,

[19:37]
the what happened is in
a bunch of dashboards, but as you build out
not just the data lake, but you build out a
knowledge graph about...
At the first most basic
level, it's like the metrics and dimensions in your BI tool
that gives you some structure around the data a little bit to find out a little bit more
structure to find out why.
It's in the diagnostic category, but that grows into a richer
knowledge graph about how people, places, things and activities in the
business are related.
And then, as you're saying,
then a causal reasoning agent can essentially traverse that and try and make sense out of
the data that's coming in and say, "Why did this happen?
" It goes beyond the dashboards.
>> One of the participants in a
previous podcast, from Fitch Group, actually
presented at a conference not too

[20:38]
long ago, Causal Rack.
So it's the next step here, right?
>> Yeah. - It does retrieval
based on what it believes to be the causal influence
of what would happen.
Again, I think it's just we're
on this maturing strategy or journey here that over time, and I think it's just a question of when all that comes about.
But you take a genetic RAG and you start over time
infusing the semantics and the causal stuff
into it, the reasoning, super powerful compared
to what you're able to do with a generative AI,
task-oriented chatbot today or assistant, which brings us to these levels of sophistication
in terms of the type of agents that you can start to think about when you are
building an agentic system or an architecture.
I'm sure there are more, and George, will get
your thoughts on this, but this was just my take on you

[21:41]
type of agents.
Obviously you're going to
need agents that are able to analyze and execute tasks.
They identify patterns.
They can detect anomalies.
If they're hooked up to predictive models, they can do forecasts and predictions, they can create stuff.
They can go off and execute
or basically automate some tasks getting done.
You're going to need those
guys, those kind of workers.
You're going to need those that really understand the domain.
If you're in a legal contracts
department, you're going to need workers, digital
workers that understand legality and contracts that are specific
to the industry you're in and the country, the region,
all that kind of stuff.
And that's when you start
getting into this notion of the semantics and
the contextual knowledge and very domain-specific
LLM underpinnings.
And then you got the agents
that will help you reason, think through things, make better decisions,

[22:42]
do some counterfactual thinking,
what if I did this instead?
And then, of course, you've got the agents that are like the managers,
they got to help you plan and they're orchestrating how all these different
agents talk to each other and work together, including humans.
It's got to be a journey over time.
This is a lot of new
potential sophistication.
What are your thoughts on
this simple four levels of sophistication?
>> I think it's a really nice
encapsulation and distillation.
We're mostly in between one and two because two, if you're
adding domain knowledge, typically it's done by RAG today and naive RAG, just chunking.
And to do more sophisticated, I think people have done
supervised fine-tuning and that's where you have a bunch of

[23:45]
data sets labeled as in
here's the information, here's the answer.
Some pair where you can do
supervised training on it or potentially fine-tuning
on a dataset beyond what something's been trained on, but we haven't done a lot of
the reasoning and decisioning.
The deep research stuff is
starting to get into that, where the vendors have shown that, and that has a little bit of also planning and orchestration, not the
orchestration, a little bit of the planning in it like,
what's the plan I'm going to go generate to go find additional information as part of the deep research.
But the orchestration is definitely people are just beginning to introduce products around that now.
That's more sophisticated.
>> Yeah, and I think when
you get into the decision intelligence, the so-called reasoning

[24:46]
and all that, I think a lot of it'll start with the tools' integration.
I'll be at the SAS Innovate
conference next week and I'm sure they're a
leader in analytics, right?
I'm sure they're going
to be talking about ways to integrate analytics into these agents.
So it's not like a
binary turn to switch off or on for it to be
decision-making or reasoning, but I think just the
sophistication is very likely to grow in time here.
Which brings us to, one thing
you've been talking a lot about, and I think you're 100% right, the offensive line in football, which is the harmonization layer, your
data, the semantic layer.
I've heard some people maybe calling it as the cognitive core.
And this is where the
knowledge, the reasoning to some degree, the goal
setting, they're all converges.
It's just a fascinating advancement.
Where do you see all this coming
together? I know you are...

[25:46]
Talk to us a little bit more
about this harmonization layer, I guess is what I'm asking.
>> Okay, so to make it what
I think is a simplified analogy, the agents are
like the self-driving cars that we had in the desert 30 years ago.
They could drive 100 miles in the desert, but they were silos in the sense that they were not driving
next to other self-driving cars or non-deterministic
pedestrians, non-deterministic as in agents where you don't
know exactly what they're going to do, or other
non-deterministic human cars.
And we still, 30 years later, don't have pervasive
autonomous driving technology, as in agents, on the road because we don't have
something like a digital four- dimensional map, something that tracks and predicts everyone's trajectory because that would allow these
self-driving cars to know where all the other agents
are and what they're doing.
And in the enterprise, we
need something like that.

[26:48]
To go back to that Disney
example, something that shares the state of the
wait time on all the rides.
That's the equivalent. You
can't coordinate everyone's experience unless there's
a shared database to say, what is the wait time on
all these different rides that I'm about to recommend you?
That's the distinction
and the common element.
>> And I think you get into
the relationships in the semantics when if the roller
coaster has a short line, if all the agents say, "Go
there at the same time," then that short lines, they
all got to be... Yeah.
>> Exactly. That's the
predict the trajectory part.
Everyone needs to essentially be able to execute a transaction and say, "Can I add my client to the line?
And if I do, what's
the weight going to be?
" Because if 10,000 agents
add their clients to the line, then the wait's going to be too long.
>> And then that's where you
kick in potentially the planning or orchestration agent, which is a manager

[27:50]
or a decision maker.
You can just go on and
there's probably an HR agent or at least let's say tracks the metrics and the effectiveness of
all these different agents.
Like Marc said, and like
Deloitte was saying, it starts over time to
replicate or augment or mirror digital twin of real workers, real people doing stuff.
>> Exactly. And that's the learning loop, where the agents representing
each visitor have to learn, did they match the
preference of the visitor?
Was their prediction about
the wait time correct?
All those models learn and then your personal
experience gets better over time.
And then the overall effectiveness
of the efficiency of the theme park's operation improves over time.
That's the collective part.
>> So we have these emerging technologies that will build upon
an LLM, generative AI, predictive foundation.
And we showed seven of them.

[28:52]
We talked a little bit
about the agentic RAG.
We talked about the reasoning, decision intelligence stuff
a little bit in the semantic harmonization layer.
It begs the question or the importance, I say it
that way, of having a well- thought-out architecture.
Again, it's going to be multi-component.
It's going to be multi-layered.
You're going to have to be able to take these modular
agents that have a job to do and many of which can act
autonomously at least in communicating and talking with each other.
So you're going to need
a control plane, right?
So what's your views?
Let's talk about architecture for a second because you mentioned
microservices as an analogy before.
I mean, it seems to me if there's ever...
Architecture matters more than
ever with this stuff compared to past technology.
>> Yeah. Well, this is why there's...
Y Combinator did this show.
Vertical agents are going to
be 10 times larger than SAS.

[29:53]
And SAS has been the story
of enterprise software for the last 25 years.
And I'm like, yes, but it's going to be
vertical agents as part of a bigger framework.
Look at the example of go back to...
Do you remember Zynga on
Facebook? This was like...
It was a game. It was essentially a verticalization of Facebook.
Facebook was a horizontal social graph.
This was the vertical of entertainment and casual gaming within that.
But they needed Facebook's platform to orchestrate the
activity of all the members of the Farmville game, for instance.
And so you couldn't do
that without the data because that social
graph had the state of...
It had everyone's relationship and the plumbing underneath,
which is what everyone's doing.
I guess what I'm trying to
say is, Zynga had a bunch

[30:56]
of agents as in users, but they were orchestrated
by this deterministic layer underneath, and they
all essentially depended economically on the goodwill of Facebook.
That's why I think that
in this agent world, the vendor who controls
the most, not just the data but how to shape it into a 4D map, again, which is a 4D map is the people, places, things and activities of the business.
We've always done snapshots
of entities, people, places, things, and mostly, we've
stored them as strings, not things semantically meaningful, but once you add the activities, that's the everybody's
moving about on the road or in the scene park.
And that's really hard.
And that's why I think much of
the value is going to accrue to that layer because we have hundreds and hundreds of semi-unicorn
customer-facing agents

[31:58]
and agent startups, and
they all need the data and the state of the
business that Salesforce has.
To me, Salesforce is the new
Facebook at least for customer- facing data and processes.
>> Yeah, and that's where it's
important to build off a lot of these technologies that
are being enabled for you.
It definitely is heading towards
a very different approach.
And I think that's how you
from last week was pointing out that you got to rethink
software from its core.
It's just not the same
as building a SaaS app that we've been doing for the last, right?
And it's different. It's
not RPA either, correct?
I mean we're talking about .
>> Well, RPA was literally hard coding what the agent figures out on its own now.
>> Yeah. Very, very different,
but incredibly powerful.
And that's, again, why
it's going to be a journey.
Well, just if you recall, George, let me bring up this chart.

[33:00]
We did a podcast, I think it
was back in early February, the ladder to agentic AI.
Just want to make everyone
aware, if you haven't watched it, you can go back and get our
views on just the high level steps here and the reason
why this architecture just really matters.
And you start off with
that foundational GEN.AI.
Think of it as the gateway into AI, and then you have to build
that domain knowledge around the use case and the
workers that you're trying to add value to.
You got to get the
explainability and the decision intelligence in there.
You got to enable these autonomous
agents to be able to talk to each other and talk to different tools and different data sets and all that.
And then, as you deploy
these things, someone's going to be needing to orchestrate and govern the workflows that,
as George just pointed out, are not static anymore.
They're not hard coded.
And then this whole thing
learns from each other as time goes by here.
So take Gen.

[34:00]
AI and LLMs, you build an
ecosystem of models around that that are unique to your business, that infuse these new capabilities.
And then you get your agents, whether you build them
yourself or you acquire them in the open market and you
wire those babies together into these workflows, and then it just adapts and gets better as time goes by.
What are you thinking there, George?
Do you think that's
still the roadmap ahead at a very high level?
>> Yeah.
-  later.
>> I think we're getting
pretty good at deploying the domain knowledge in the models, but like you said, those
more advanced steps are going to take some skills and some technology that
it's not fully mature yet.
But I do think the one thing I would add when you're talking about
multi-agent systems is that there needs to be
a framework for them

[35:01]
to get feedback from.
And that is the same
framework where you set up to answer the questions about
the business, what happened, why, what's likely to happen,
and what should we do?
Those become the metrics, and the tree of metrics
becomes the model of how your business behaves and just the way that's
meant to give feedback to people about their
performance and their goals and how it ties into the
bigger corporate performance.
As that metric tree becomes
live, not just hard-coded rules, then the agent that's helping the
customer service department or trying to autonomously
help a customer in customer service can say, "I want
to make sure I'm responding that within the parameters of the customer satisfaction goals, but I also want to respect
the overall corporate profitability goals.
I don't want to do something
that's going to tank, that's to cost so much that...
" In other words, you up something,

[36:01]
you set up this model
of corporate performance that's reflected in metrics and that becomes a way to
teach agents how to perform.
>> Right. And then you optimize against those metrics and then...
Yeah, it's a very different world.
Before we wrap up here, George, I'm sure a lot in our audience
are just getting started with this, trying to understand
what this is all about.
What would be your advice be for the first step they should take here?
Just to, how do I get started?
>> I think it depends then on who you are.
Frankly, if you're just
getting started now, you're probably like a
mainstream corporate developer or data engineer or business analyst.
You're not in a tech center company because they're putting the
pieces together themselves.

[37:01]
So if you're in a mainstream shop, I would look at your
current platform providers, whether it's your enterprise
application vendors, whether Oracle or Salesforce or SAP.
And essentially, they're going to have agents built into
the apps that augment and automate some of
the tasks or workflows or processes that are already in that app.
But here you're still
just reinforcing the silos that are already there, but that's okay.
You're having scoped
productivity improvement.
I think the next step would be with your analytic data foundation,
you're going to have agents for helping the data
engineers build pipelines.
You're going to have agents.
You can already find these from
your data platform vendors, agents for your data scientists
working in the notebooks to help them with feature
engineering and experiments.
And you would have agents within your

[38:03]
business intelligence now for your essentially business analysts or for your end users to be
able to talk to the data.
So there's many different angles.
We haven't brought them all together yet.
They would all be today augmentations of your existing systems.
>> Right. You got to
build from what you have.
>> Yeah.
- All right. All right, George, this has been a great conversation here.
Very informative, very
meaningful, I think.
Thanks so much for taking
the time to be here.
>> Always fun to join you, Scott.
>> Yeah, we'll keep
doing these. It's great.
And for all of you, I hope you found this conversation insightful.
I certainly did. There's no doubt that we're entering the
golden age of AI agents, a total reset on how software
is designed, built, and used, and perhaps the biggest since the e- business days 25 years ago with
the advent of the internet.
It really is a big change.
And this opportunity, as
George was just pointing out, is no longer theoretical.

[39:03]
It's real. It's growing.
It's available to those
with the clarity of vision and the urgency to get going and act.
So one thing you can also do
is make sure you check out the AI Agent Builder Summit that we just held with 20 industry pioneers.
You can find that on thecube.
net or out on our YouTube channel.
Also, make sure, again,
you go watch the interview that Dave Vellante and George did with Salesforce, Marc Benioff.
Again, really good insightful conversation that I highly recommend.
So anyhow, thank you for
tuning in. Take care.
We'll see you on the next
episode of The Next Frontiers of AI.
We are the leader in
tech news and analysis.
See you for next time around. Bye all.
