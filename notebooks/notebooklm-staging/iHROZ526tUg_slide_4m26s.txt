## Transcript Context
**Before:** among multiple options. They're going to need to help people actually engage and interrogate the agent, to ask what-if questions, to discover how does my business actually operate?
**During:** What are the causal effects on different actions,
**After:** different conditions, different interventions that I can make? How does that change an outcome? What are the root causes of a particular problem I have?
