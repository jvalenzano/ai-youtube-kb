# 19. From PoC to Production: Scaling Agentic AI in Financial Services

**Video ID:** QKaZvIX4ziI
**Channel:** SiliconANGLE theCUBE
**Duration:** 40:21
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKaZvIX4ziI

**Module:** Case Studies & Lessons
**Module Rationale:** The video centers on real-world implementation challenges in financial services, featuring a detailed wealth management POC demonstration and practical deployment experiences with specific clients

## Summary
- Two-thirds of AI projects in financial services fail to reach production, with failure rates doubling over the past year due to legacy infrastructure, data silos, and governance challenges
- Financial services organizations are mostly stuck in stages 1-2 of AI maturity (content generation and basic RAG) while fintechs advance to stages 3-4 with agentic AI workflows
- Agentic AI requires persistent memory, real-time data processing, vector search capabilities, and seamless integration - fundamentally different from traditional batch-processing architectures
- MongoDB provides AI-ready architecture with real-time unstructured data handling, vector search, domain-specific embeddings, and MCP server support for agent orchestration
- Wealth management POC demonstrates multi-agent system with market analysis, news analysis, and ReAct agents working collaboratively while maintaining human-in-the-loop controls
- Trust remains the primary barrier to AI adoption in high-stakes financial use cases, requiring techniques like RAG, domain-specific models, re-ranking, and explainable AI
- Future evolution points toward decision intelligence combining causal AI, knowledge graphs, and reasoning capabilities beyond current pattern recognition limitations
- Success requires building flexible, adaptable data infrastructure from the ground up rather than patching solutions onto legacy systems

## Key Takeaways
- **DO:** Build AI-ready data architecture with real-time processing, vector search, and horizontal scalability before implementing AI applications
- **DO:** Implement human-in-the-loop controls for high-risk financial use cases to maintain trust and compliance
- **DO:** Use domain-specific embedding models and re-ranking techniques to improve accuracy and reduce hallucination
- **DO:** Design multi-agent systems with persistent memory and context sharing capabilities for complex workflows
- **DON'T:** Don't build AI solutions as patchwork on top of legacy systems - this leads to production failures
- **DON'T:** Don't rely solely on LLMs for decision-making in financial services without additional reasoning and causal analysis capabilities

## TL;DR
Financial services AI projects fail at production due to legacy infrastructure requiring purpose-built agentic architectures.

## Full Transcript

>> Hello and welcome back to the
Next Frontiers of AI podcast where we explore the
innovations, strategies and real-world stories shaping
the future of enterprise AI.
I'm your host, Scott Hebner, principal analyst at theCUBE Research.
And as always, thank you so much for taking the time to tune in.
Today, we're going to tackle a challenge that keeps many leaders up at night, especially in the financial
services industry.
Why does roughly two-thirds
of AI projects stall before making it into production?
And for those that do
make it into production, why do they often fail to scale in line with the needs of the business?
This is a problem that's
become even more urgent with the advent of agentic
AI where higher-stakes, use cases on demand even
greater trust in governance and execution discipline.
The reality is that most proof-of-concepts or POCs never make it into production.
And with agentic AI's complexity
with persistent memory

[01:02]
and reasoning and autonomous
action, the barriers to success, the deployments that make it successful
are becoming even higher.
In this episode, we're going
to explore what really happens behind this POC to production gap, and more importantly, how to overcome it.
We'll also deep dive into how to create an agentic AI
architecture that is designed to meet these challenges.
Joining me to unpack all
this is Peyman Parsi, a senior principal for
financial services at MongoDB.
Peyman has been working closely with some of the world's largest banks and financial institutions to
not only experiment with AI, but to build solutions that
make it into production, deliver ROI and scale with the
needs of the business.
Peyman, let me bring you up here.
Thank you so much for
taking the time to be here.
It's greatly appreciated.
>> Yeah. Thank you for the
invitation. Great to be here, Scott.
>> It's been a while. I
think we first got a chance to talk at the AWS Financial Services

[02:03]
Symposium in New York City.
I think that was back in what late May or something like that?
>> Yeah. That was a great event. Yeah.
>> Yeah. I really enjoyed it and our conversation was really great.
>> Absolutely.
- So before we jump into the technical and operational challenges, maybe you can give our
listeners a quick sense of your role at MongoDB and your perspective on how AI is unfolding in
the financial services industry right now.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
So I'm responsible for financial services industry
solution in North America.
So I work with variety of FSI companies from fintech to top three, the US banks and Canadian banks across
the board, a very large transformation program around data.
And I partner with them primarily with the technology leaders to make sure they have the
right data solution, bridging

[03:03]
the gap between financial
services domain expertise and also technology expertise.
But these days, data play
a key role in all the transformation and where we
play to make sure we enable and accelerate those
transformations for our client, making sure they have
the right solution at the enterprise scale.
So a lot of the customers
that we are dealing with, they are large in size and they have different
type of challenges compared to smaller companies,
and it's very diverse.
So these days, most of
the discussion focus on AI because the AI is a
top strategy everywhere and pretty much across FSI and implementation of
that is a different story, but everybody has strategy around AI and trying to do something about it.
>> Yeah. My experience over
my career has been some of the most difficult challenges around financial services when it comes to deploying new technologies.
And if it can be solved
in financial services,

[04:04]
it provides lessons for
all the other industries.
So I think you're in the
middle of the hot spot here where some of these
challenges surface first and it's in a high stakes environment, obviously dealing with people's money.
>> Yeah. For sure. Financial
services typically has the investment and backing
from financial perspective to make things happen, but environment is highly regulated as well at the same time.
If it passes those gates, the
industry will follow for sure.
>> Well, let's start with
a headline statistic, and I sort of reference this
a little bit in the intro, but that a majority of these projects and financial services simply
don't make it into production.
And for those that do, they often face an uphill battle to scale.
So in your experience, what is happening behind the scenes here?
Why is there such a high failure rate?
As you can see here on the
graphic, 56% is darn high.

[05:05]
And in this survey from S&P Global, it actually doubled the rate that have basically been abandoned,
doubled over the last year.
So that's a pretty daunting
challenge, for any industry, but particularly in financial services.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
And these numbers and stats align to what I
see across the industry, sometimes even is higher
in certain segments of financial services.
I think when you look at
what's happening at the board of directors and senior
management, they all ask about AI and AI strategy is core
part of future innovation for large financial organizations.
And when it comes to CIO and CTO to respond to that, when you look at their landscape,
there's still 80% legacy and the digital transformation that has started years ago is still going and it's not delivered yet.
So in that environment, there's
a lot of complexity, a lot of technical debt and the data infrastructure also not ready

[06:07]
for the type of AI application
to be built on top.
So when you look at the
fragmented data across multiple different department,
multiple different areas, there's data silos,
there's no single source of truth from data perspective.
That's where we exactly help
our customers to try to find what is the right data infrastructure before they think about
bringing different type of technology and making
sure the foundation is correct for that.
So what's happening in
the industry, majority of these use cases is
easy to experiment, but before going to production, there's a lot of gates in financial services, both financially from
regulation perspective and also quality and trust.
And the industry is
struggling with all this.
And so part of that is it's very hard to build a foundation that
is adaptable and agile and flexible, and that's where we play on
MongoDB side, try to bring

[07:08]
that flexibility to the industry.
What's in reality happens, a lot of these use cases getting
implemented as a patchwork on top of what they have in terms of legacy and also in terms of existing challenges.
You're not trying to solve the problem, you're just tactically
responding to an event.
And this is something that
fundamentally companies and especially banks and large financial
organizations need to resolve.
>> Yeah. I think the message
there is it's not just a technical problem, it's
organizational inertia, it's the trust issue, which I
think I hear everywhere I go with governance gaps.
You got compliance.
You got how much clarity is there on the ROI and sort of overlap- >> Yeah.
There's trust problem as well.
And also skill set, it's a big
gap in the industry as well because the AI is moving so fast and everybody need to keep up.
It's no longer optional.
>> Yeah. There's no doubt about that

[08:09]
and with everything moving at warp speed, it's increasingly hard to
keep up with everything.
I mean, we've been through
technology transformations before and it seems like going all
the way back to mainframe to client server, they
unfold faster and faster and we're living in warp speed
now with all this AI stuff.
>> Yeah. Our focus on the
data side, what we see, so AI require real-time data, but there's also more
than 85% of the data used by AI is unstructured data.
And these organizations are not properly structured around handling
real-time unstructured data or hybrid data or semi-structured data.
And also they data
ingestion is one part of it, but also get the context
out of that data in a form that is understandable and create value for your
business is also another challenge where capabilities like vector search and embedding comes to the play

[09:09]
and these are all new technologies for a lot of FSI companies.
>> Yeah. And that brings us to, so as our industry is increasingly shifting to building on generative AI
and LLMs to build AI agents and agentic workflows, how do you see this
changing things, right?
I mean after all, the main
difference here is there autonomy, decision-making
abilities, the purpose of becoming essentially collaborative
digital workers in the workforce.
And you actually have a great
chart on this that I'm going to bring up here and maybe
you can just talk a little bit about how you see this
evolution occurring in financial services and how the challenges
that you just talked about shift a little bit as time goes by here.
>> Yeah. So this is an interesting
chart when you look at stage one where a couple years ago LLM were introduced and pretty much all the
companies trying to figure out what are the use cases that
this technology can be applied

[10:11]
to, what business
problem they can resolve?
And majority was content
generation, marketing, and I would say low risk
use cases, but high value.
And then when you look at
stage two, which where majority of the large financial
organization are between stage one and two is implementation of
rack solution where you try to get more relevant and more
accurate response from AI and being able to implement something that is production ready.
And even simple use cases could be implemented in
production with some level of accuracy and some level of trust.
So by majority of large banks and large financial
organizations are stage one and two, focusing on horizontal more use cases in AI around corporate GPTs, knowledge
base, things like that.

[11:12]
While the industry is
moving to stage three and four when you look at the fintechs and larger fintech companies.
So they're all moving toward
more advanced agentic, bringing this AI agent and multi-agents and trying to solve the business problem and create values for their
businesses around multi- agent landscape.
So the delta between stage
one and two and three and four are getting wider and wider and this is concerning in the industry because some of the companies
that get stuck stage one and two, it's very hard
for them to keep up.
>> Yeah. If you fall behind
in today's, as I was saying before, the warp speed
of everything shifting and the innovation is
you may never catch up.
Right? So it's critical
here to try to get ahead of these challenges, right?
>> And I think AI has a
lot of powers in terms of when you look at
combining that, the human

[12:14]
brain and also decision
making, not everything has to be fully autonomous.
So it could be human
in the loop use cases, especially in financial
services if you're dealing with the high risk use
cases, makes sense to go with that type of solution.
And when you want to
scale, having this multi- agent orchestration that in a way that this agent can collaborate and run multiple workflows in parallel, it would be a game changer.
But we are not there from
the industry perspective yet.
>> Yeah. Let's shift there.
You've been talking quite a bit about the technology foundation for agentic AI and its need for persistent
memory, you have vector search, you have the interaction around
history that has occurred, the context window, all that,
to even a greater extent, you've got seamless integration.
It just puts a lot of
pressure on the underlying data architecture.
So in your view, in your
experience in financial services, what does AI ready look like in terms of an architectural point of view

[13:17]
and how should companies in
that industry go about de- risking these deployments?
>> Yeah. So there are a few characteristics for a data solution to be ready for AI.
So definitely being able to handle data in real time is one of those key capabilities.
So these AI systems today,
they need immediate response.
If you are doing fraud
detection, for example, in financial services or you're doing a loan
approval, time is in essence and it cannot be done by the batch so it's primarily a real time capability.
And also, when you look
at this screen here, so in the agentic landscape, MongoDB becomes a persistent
layer of these agents by saving all the historical
interaction become these agents are stateful.
So our solution become more
like a memory for short-term and long-term data store.

[14:18]
But in addition to that, once
you store the data, so most of this data are in the
form of unstructured data.
The database need to be able to handle unstructured
data in AI landscape, but also be able to
retrieve that data in a form of vector search and
contextual search to be able to do reasoning and action
that are driving decisions, otherwise going to be just a basic query and it can be enhanced by domain- specific embedding and also re-ranking.
So these are all within the
scope of increasing accuracy of the response from AI, but also industry is moving
fast by creating some standards.
We support MCP servers as well.
So we're in the process of launching that.
We had a private preview.
So these MCP servers are game changer because it will enable the data store for agents to interact with.
And I think combination
of all that it makes,

[15:20]
I would say the good foundation, MongoDB has a good foundation
for being a backbone of AI power banking.
We also support horizontal
scalability seamlessly, which is required by AI.
So amount of data that
the AI need to handle and it's just going to exponentially grow.
So this is part of what we offer as well.
>> Yeah. We had a big conversation around that I remember at the AWS
Financial Services Symposium.
So this basically represents
the stack, if you will, that MongoDB is building out.
And then what you're doing as
I understand it, is taking it and now you're applying
it to different use cases, different domains, and your role is to help apply it all in the financial services context, right?
>> Yeah. This one is in particular
for AI agent and agentic.
So we have different
capabilities in MongoDB that is not on that slide.
So it's basically a data
platform for developers

[16:21]
to use certain capabilities,
not only for AI but also in data flexibility,
schema flexibility, asset transaction,
aggregation, ETL, number of different capabilities as well.
But one thing in that diagram
was very important, also, seamless integration
with AI tools and models.
So we have that because everything that we implement is API based and is built for modern
type of application.
That seamless integration is very easy.
>> Yeah. One of the things
I love that you were doing and what we talked a
little bit about offline and when we were together in New York was helping your customers with POCs and you have created a
wealth management POC that I think is really impressive.
And I think it's a great example that kind of illustrates the power of
what you can do with agentic AI and in this particular case,
it's for wealth management.
Let me just bring up the summary

[17:23]
that you have on what this does.
Now you describe it a little bit and then we'll take a
quick look at a demo of it.
>> Yeah. For sure. So across
our industry solution offering, we built a number of
different demos to showcase how easy it is to implement different type of solutions with MongoDB.
This one is particularly
for wealth management and agentic AI, where in today's markets there is large amount
of unstructured data.
If you look at what happened
in stock market in the past few months, so majority of
those changes in direction of the market triggered by tweet messages or social media messages or news messages, none
of that is typically part of the structured data that is available in capital
market across larger companies.
And so what we are trying to showcase here is easy
ingestion of that data, unstructured data

[18:23]
and also run AI agents on
top to analyze that data and create actionable insight
for portfolio managers.
And in a way that is not fully autonomous, it's human in the loop use case.
And we think because in
this wealth management demo, we are showcasing that we're dealing with financial asset reallocation, that this is very sensitive and if AI agent make a
mistake, the impact is going to be very severe.
So we wanted to showcase also
human in the loop at the end of the day, portfolio
manager make final decision, but we provide this agent
will create all sorts of actionable insights for the
portfolio manager to be able to make those decisions.
And the amount of data today in the market with unstructured data is not something that human can comprehend.
And as I mentioned earlier,
this data needs to be real-time, needs be contextual.
So portfolio managers
need summary of this data,

[19:25]
need explanation of the data,
not just pure data ingestion.
That's where these agents would shine.
>> Yeah. And what's interesting,
so each one of these agents have an LLM and a graph.
>> Yeah.
- Can you explain that a little bit more?
>> Yeah. So the two agents
that are responsible for market analysis and news analysis because those are constant data.
So they run constantly
and they analyze that data and create reports for portfolio
manager that every morning with this portfolio manager can review and look at those analysis and get full insight of what's
happening in the market.
But there is a third agent on
the right side of that diagram that is more prompt agent
is a ReAct agent where there is shift in the
market middle of the day and portfolio manager
need to ask question what to do at this point or some question coming
up at the portfolio level that is not answered
by the other two agent.
This is very flexible.

[20:25]
It's a prompt base, more like
an assistant, more like a co- worker of portfolio manager and portfolio manager can ask
question about reallocation, about the stocks, about everything that's happening in the market.
And that agent is fully
autonomous, has ability to select the right tool
to answer the questions and it's very handy because
it's not predefined.
So you can ask any type of questions and it also has web searching
capability behind the scene through a tool called  tool and it cannot find the answers
can go out also search the web for you and bring that
information. Very impressive.
>> So each one of these have a knowledge graph and then- >> That's right.
- ...
through the MCP protocols that's how they share context and information? Is that how >> Yeah.
The MCP protocol, we are
implementing that in phase two.
It's going to be launched
next week actually, but right now the way they
interact, they interact

[21:27]
with MongoDB directly
through query language.
>> Yeah. And then moving to
knowledge graphs over time?
>> Yeah. Absolutely.
And also the vector search capability is critical part of it.
We also use domain-specific models.
So Voyage AI is a company that MongoDB acquired a few months ago and we implemented the
finance domain-specific models to get higher quality
response from these agents.
So that's integrated as
part of our solution.
And this solution is publicly available.
We have the links, you can
publish that as well, Scott.
If somebody want to go and download the GitHub
repository, it's a container-based, you can run it yourself and see in action.
>> Well, let's take a look at it and maybe you can just talk us
through the quick demo here.
>> Yeah. This is the main screen.
In the middle of the page,
you can see the portfolio with different stocks and different colorful
indicators like Wix, GDP, interest rate, unemployment
rate and sentiment score.

[22:31]
This is where the AI
provide the explanation to portfolio manager
with different indicators and different explanation
of those predefined reports that the other two
agents that I mentioned.
So there are some charting capability, MongoDB support Atlas Charts, which if you have the data in MongoDB, you can create easily different charts.
So this section is showing news sentiment and the way that news is extracted and we run an algorithm
vector search as well to drive the news.
And also this is the
document model projection and enhancement throughout
the workflow of the agents and we showcase that.
This particular one is the ReAct agent, which is prompt-based.
And you can ask question, some of these questions predefined, but there is a free text form
about allocation of portfolio and this particular question is about what to do in this current market condition and agent is responding.

[23:32]
And there is a tool that is selected that shows here on the screen that the agent selected that tool.
When you run a different
question around, for example, this one is about equity and gold.
And so you can see different
tools is triggered here and AI agent will try to figure
out what is the best answer.
At the end of the day
also, as I mentioned, it's human in the loop in
financial high-risk use cases.
Still that's going to
be the case for a while until these agents trust
and quality increases.
>> Yeah. And then over
time this becomes more and more of a co-worker, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah.
- Where they're partying up with people and that this is how they get work done.
>> Yeah. Absolutely. So
 the name of chatbots to assistant is really an assistant to the portfolio manager and coworker.
>> Yeah. Yeah. And then an agent, which I think we'll get into
a little bit more in terms of the sophistication of them
as they grow over time

[24:34]
becoming even more than just an assistant, they actually become
a collaborator, right?
>> Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
>> We're heading in interesting
way, which brings me just to get your perspectives on
this whole notion of trust.
Everywhere I go, trust is the overriding concern
that people have, right?
>> Yeah. - Not just trust from
a technology perspective in terms of security and compliance, but users are only going
to actually use this stuff and get value added if
they trust the answers and the explanations.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
- So when you are working with these much higher risk use cases, whether it be fraud protection or the wealth management that we just saw, or any kind of operational
decision making, how do you balance all the automation with the human in the loop controls along with the transparency that's
needed and the governance and the compliance and all that?
>> Yeah. I think what I see
in the industry, the trend is for larger organization
that they can bring in

[25:35]
and host the model.
Some of them they bring
it in terms of privacy and making sure the
governance is satisfied.
But going back to the trust,
the models are improving and there's a lot of R&D in
the industries across improving the trust factor for this
and quality of the responses.
But there are a couple of other techniques that I frequently use today.
A different type of rack
solution, it seems to be one of the most practical option
that is cost-effective and also increase the
quality significantly.
So agentic RAG or basic RAG or graphRAG, combination of retrieval- augmented retrieval.
So it's kind of providing the enough context to the LLM models
to be more accurate, retrieval-augmented generation.
But there is also another layer that

[26:37]
quite a bit being discussed and implemented is around
domain specific models that I mentioned earlier.
So if you are in certain industry and you want these models
to be tailored toward what you are doing, there are models, embedding models especially
available like that, like Voyage AI that I mentioned,
that what we are trying to integrate as part of Mongo.
There's also re-ranking capability in that because when you receive the answer or retrieve the answer, so the ranking also plays
a big role in quality of what you want to provide.
And the ranking is also part
of that kind of combination, combination of domain specific retrieval, but also proper ranking of the results.
And there are other advancement in the industry
to reduce the hallucination.
There's a lot of
discussion about causal AI and other techniques,

[27:38]
but is really looking
forward to those capabilities to come in to increase the trust.
So there's a lot of activities going on, but I think that the trust
question is very valid question and we are watching that
very closely as well.
>> Yeah. Going back to where
I think this is all heading, and the next frontier I think we're going to be entering into is really
around decision intelligence.
And LLMs are really not
designed to be decision- making entities because
they're based on correlation and pattern recognition.
And I know there's a lot of things that can help provide the
information to make decisions, but they're not good at
helping to rationalize choices, perform what-if analysis.
They don't handle changing
environments very well in terms of if you were to do
counterfactual reasoning with it.
Bottom line is you brought up causal AI, LLMs alone have a tendency
to confuse correlation with causation or they don't
recognize hidden factors

[28:40]
that might be influencing a outcome.
And it certainly can't, even though if there's
a hundred parameters that are influencing an
outcome, it can't rank them because you might find
out there's only four out of a hundred that actually really matter and you don't need all that data. Right?
>> Yeah. Absolutely.
- What's your view of where this is all heading in terms of, not necessarily from
a MongoDB perspective, but just overall if you were to look out the years ahead,
let's just say, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah.
- Do you think this notion of decision intelligence, causality,
causal knowledge graphs, do you think that's going
to come on the scene?
>> So I think so.
I think this is one of the trends and we are watching very closely, although it's more experimental, but I think what's happened
in reality is usually combination of different technologies that make the final answer or create that quality in terms of trust.
I'll give you an example
in fraud detection in

[29:41]
financial services.
So there are solutions
around generative AI and RAG and using vector search and AI, LLM oriented fraud detection, but it doesn't mean that it's going to replace the machine learning or rule-based fraud detection
that's already in place.
It just enhanced the quality of them by reducing false positive and create another layer on
top that we get better service and better root cause analysis and better explanation of
those fraud transactions.
But also at the same
time, if there are pattern or similarity that you can determine with different techniques,
this will be added value.
So with causal AI, I think it's going to be very similar the way I see that.
So the current advancement
is going to be in place and that's going to enhance
it even yet to the next level.
>> Yeah. We hear at theCUBE Research, we actually just fielded
some primary research

[30:41]
surveys, a large number of
respondents in our space.
And one of the things that it's going to explore is decision intelligence, where that's all heading,
what the state of it is, what people find to be
important is part of that, you get into knowledge
graphs and you get into RAG and you get into chain of thought and certainly you get into causal AI.
>> Yeah. - And since we brought
this up, let me just, I went and got in the background here, just to chart just on casual
AI, just a little bit of background on it for our audience, since we're getting into this.
There's a lot of
potential benefits to this and there are implementations of it.
For example, Uber uses it,
Netflix uses it, Georgia- Pacific uses it.
A lot of manufacturing
type environments use this because they need to
understand root cause, right?
>> Yeah.
- And they need to understand, think about a knowledge graph.
It represents relationships
between entities,

[31:43]
context mapping between
entities, the meaning, right?
It's semantic knowledge, but while it can represent relationships, it can't tell you the cause and effect nature of those relationships.
>> Yeah.
- So we have inflation rate in Switzerland and I have a decrease in the
value of the dollar in the UK, there might be a relationship, but you don't have an understanding of the causality of it, right?
>> Yeah. Absolutely. And
it's very interesting what's happening in the agentic
landscape with ReAct agent because those ReAct agent are
reasoning in action as well.
So kind of overlapping a little bit, although not exactly the same, but I think it would be also
interesting to see these technologies emerges together
and create even higher value.
>> Yeah. I think of it as a
whole bunch of ingredients, causal AI, just like knowledge
graphs and just like cause

[32:44]
and effect and just like GraphRAG and we just keep adding more and more ingredients
to what we can cook up.
And I think with causal knowledge graphs, which is basically a more
sophisticated knowledge graph, you get a lot of these benefits.
Right? What if this, and it can help you do counterfactual analysis here, it can start
to understand know-how.
I like that the causal AI
graphs can actually explain the precise chain of events
that lead to an outcome.
So they're highly explainable.
The bottom line here I
think is the LLMs are kind of telling you what to do, but they're not necessarily
telling you how to do it or why that is the right
thing to do among multiple alternate things you
can potentially pursue.
And so I think as time goes
by here, I'm for one convinced that it'll become more and
more of the repertoire of what people have to work with
just to make these agents better at helping humans actually
make decisions rather than

[33:47]
just giving them information.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
Causal AI also have a
lot of promises around hallucination reduction significantly, so it's all going to help.
Yeah. For sure.
>> All right. Well, before we wrap up here, let's talk a little bit about
what you see as coming next.
I know we kind of just
touched on the causal elements of things and just decision intelligence, but if we, again, look out
longer term, three to five years, what does a mature AI- powered financial services
organization look like and what are you recommending to your clients in terms of how they prepare themselves for that?
>> Yeah. - And as you answer
that question, I'm going to bring up a chart here
that I love that you created that kind of talks about how MongoDB has been rapidly evolving with
the needs of their clients.
>> Yeah. Absolutely. And I
think it is hard to say three to five years because things are changing by month or by week these days.

[34:48]
>> Yeah.
- It's hard to predict that.
But if you look at our
journey on MongoDB, so built for change from the
get-go, from beginning.
We introduced flexible
document model back in 2007, and then followed by
Atlas, our cloud offering, ability to run MongoDB
everywhere, basically on-prem in your laptop or on the cloud.
And then significant
improvement over time.
In 2023, we introduced
AI ready architecture by introducing vector search capability.
We knew that AI is going to
be a game changer technology and we prepare ourselves
to be ultimate database for AI workload.
And since then, we try to
listen to our customers and also follow the industry to bring AI related capability
like stream processing.
Majority of the data that comes for AI and needs to be stored
and needs to be retrieved,

[35:48]
it's in the form of streaming.
We develop those capabilities and brought into the database
level, also with embedding and re-ranking.
So with the recent acquisition
of Voyage AI, we are bringing that to the database level and this is all built
based on robust security and also seamless scalability.
So the AI workload requires
that real-time interaction, but also scalability horizontally because amount of data is unpredictable and you need to be ready for that.
At the end of the day, we are
building an infrastructure and foundation for AI workload
that is flexible, agile, and adaptable for future.
And I'm pretty sure AI would
not be the last innovation.
So whatever you build,
think about long term and build the right infrastructure
for it as well. Yeah.
>> Yeah. And you've been
touching on throughout this conversation today, and again, when we talked in New York about domain specific use cases and- >> Yeah.

[36:49]
Those ones are in financial industry, it's very applicable and with the quality that you
need so definitely a must.
So this is just an example of
some of the use cases we work with our customers and the
possibilities are endless.
So here there are some examples
around portfolio management, loan credit scoring, customer
personalization, AI assistant for customer service, market
research, document management, summarization, and really when
you have unstructured data and you combine it with
your existing structure data and run contextual search on top of that to understand the meaning of that data and then drive efficiencies
and decision-making.
So the possibilities are
endless for these use cases.
>> Yeah. It's great to see. I
think that's the future too, is domain specific models, right?
Agents that understand specific
domains like the wealth management part of financial services

[37:51]
and the more vertical they become and the more nuanced
around the actual workers that perform those tasks,
the more likely they are to become collaborators
and not just assistants and helping people get work done.
And without those
mindset around use cases, which I love what MongoDB is doing here.
I mean, clearly you have
the use cases thought out and being implemented along
with just the technology, right?
>> Yeah. And as the agent and AI learn from that experience,
the trust factor is going to go up at the same time for those particular use cases. Yeah.
>> Exactly. All right, Peyman.
This has been awesome, but
it's time for us to wrap up.
Very insightful conversation,
very illustrative and like I've always
said, keeping track of what happens in financial services, what happens there is going to happen elsewhere
across other industries, particularly given the unique
characteristics of it in terms of regulations and decision-making

[38:52]
and things of that nature.
So thanks much for taking
the time to be here and sharing all your perspectives.
For our listeners, the
takeaway is quite clear here.
In a high-risk, high-reward
domain like finance, in particular, success with AI isn't just
about building something that's impressive in the
lab and makes a good demo.
It's about creating
the right architecture, having the right governance, having the operational
readiness to deliver real- world impact based on trust.
It has to work in production and needs to be trusted by
the users that are going to use it because after all, trust is becoming the
currency of innovation.
If there's no trust, there's no ROI.
