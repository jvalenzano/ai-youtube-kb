# 27. How Agentic AI Rewires a SaaS Business: Lessons from a Unicorn Pioneer

**Video ID:** hQfmq63zh38
**Channel:** SiliconANGLE theCUBE
**Duration:** 34:29
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQfmq63zh38

**Module:** Case Studies & Lessons
**Module Rationale:** This video presents a detailed real-world case study of Vantaca's successful implementation of agentic AI at scale, with specific metrics, before/after examples, and business outcomes

## Summary
- Vantaca, a $1.25 billion unicorn in community association management, has successfully transformed from traditional property management software to an AI-first platform delivering digital labor augmentation
- The company has processed over 1 million AI-enabled workflows, demonstrating massive scale in agentic AI deployment for real-world business operations
- Digital labor differs from simple automation by applying judgment, reasoning, and expertise to complex knowledge work rather than just executing predefined tasks
- Vantaca's HOAI voice agent reduces human call handling time by up to 90%, freeing staff for higher-value community engagement work
- The company built a UI-first, API-first, and AI-first architecture from the ground up, creating the ideal infrastructure for agentic AI deployment
- Early adopters of agentic AI in the industry are discovering unique competitive advantages, with a tipping point expected in the next 18-24 months
- Success requires reimagining work processes and involving cross-organizational teams, not just implementing technology
- The transformation enables proactive community management rather than reactive response to requests, improving both operational efficiency and customer experience

## Key Takeaways
- **DO:** Build configurable workflows that can adapt to different business contexts and serve as guardrails for AI agents
- **DO:** Architect systems to be UI-first for humans, API-first for integrations, and AI-first for agent capabilities
- **DO:** Focus on knowledge-centered work where AI performs, plans, and collaborates as digital coworkers rather than just automating simple tasks
- **DO:** Reinvest cost savings from AI into growth, innovation, and improved customer service rather than just reducing headcount
- **DON'T:** Treat AI agents as second-class citizens with limited access - they need the same capabilities as human users
- **DON'T:** Focus solely on chatbots or simple task automation without reimagining how work gets done organizationally

## Full Transcript

>> Hello and welcome back to The
Next Frontier of AI podcast, where we explore the innovations and the strategies
shaping the future of AI.
I'm your host, Scott
Hebner here at SiliconANGLE Media theCUBE Research.
Thanks so much for tuning in.
Today, we're going to examine
one of the most fascinating, and frankly transformative
shifts occurring across the modern service businesses,
the rise of digital labor as an operating model.
While anchored in agentic AI,
digital labor is considered by most to be a broader phenomenon.
Our recent digital labor
transformation index suggests three things.
One, the air of digital labor
augmentation is inevitable and will occur sooner than most think.
Secondly, those who
succeed are those who go beyond the technology and reimagine how work actually gets done, involving cross organizational teams.
And interesting enough,
fewer are doing that today, only about 8% that actually
include HR, for example.

[01:01]
And finally, most importantly, those that will see the highest ROI
aren't the ones just adding chatbots or automating tasks.
It's the ones shifting their
focus towards knowledge- centered work, AI that performs and plans and collaborates as digital coworkers.
This is the type of work
that applies knowledge and expertise and
judgment to problem solve and to make better decisions.
This, in my opinion, is what's going to define the transformative value of what everyone's calling it as
the golden age of AI agents, not simply automation to cut costs.
Few companies embody
this transformation more clearly than Vantaca.
The newly minted $1.
25 billion unicorn that has redefined what is possible in community management, by building a UI first, API first, and AI first SaaS architecture
from the ground up, designed with digital labor augmentation in mind.
This is the agentic AI in the
wild at scale, in production,

[02:05]
delivering measurable
financial, operational and customer outcomes.
It is what happens when a
agentic AI stops being just a technology and becomes a business system.
Today, we're joined by Ben
Currin, the CEO of Vantaca, to unpack what it really
takes to build this type of business and why the
market is hungry for this type of transformation.
So, Ben, let me bring you
up here. There you are.
Thanks again for joining us.
>> Yeah, Scott. Happy to join
and have a conversation today.
Thank you. Thank you for carving
out the time to talk to me.
>> Yeah, but eager to talk to you because I think you have one of the most clear success
stories so far out there, from at least what I'm
seeing in agentic AI and applying not just the technology, but to actually help your
clients transform how they work and with real outcomes.
So, we're going to get into
that as we go through here.
But anyhow, you had recent
appearances on the New York Stock Exchange Wired program
and theCUBE conversations.

[03:08]
They were very popular.
A lot of people tuned in to see them.
But for this audience, can
you give us a little bit of a background to get
started here on Vantaca and your personal journey to become CEO?
>> Sure, sure. Absolutely.
So Vantaca, for anyone
who doesn't know, Vantaca, we're a technology provider and really a platform
company in the community association management space.
So, not obvious what the community association
management space is.
There's this big industry that is specialized property
management around the ecosystem that is community living.
And so, that's HOA,
homeowner association living, condominium association living, co-ops, and not only the management
of those properties, but the financial management
of those communities.
So, billing of homeowners,
contracting with vendors, management of insurance, management of everything from banking
integrations to payments and workflows,
architectural requests, kind of everything in between.
And so, Vantaca is really
the system of record for all

[04:10]
of those transactions, all
of that work, that industry, the system of work for all
of that back office work and community level work that's happening.
And then the engagement with
the community to the board and the management company
and the vendors within, and now we're able to do so
much of that work with AI.
So, that's a little bit
about Vantaca and what we do and kind of the industry and
the ecosystem that we play in.
Your other question, Scott,
how the heck did I get here?
I think my journey into
community association management, much like almost
everyone into community association management is
not a straight line, right?
So I didn't grow up in the
community association management world like most people didn't.
My prior career, I was a nuclear engineer and a submarine officer in the US Navy before kind of transitioning
into a career in technology.
And what was so fascinating to me when I first got introduced
to this industry is just how much friction there
is in the system of kind

[05:10]
of community living.
It's this thing that should be
so beneficial, but it's hard.
It's hard to manage thousands and thousands of homes
as a property manager with different rules across
different communities that you have to enforce.
And all of that to us has just
looked like an opportunity to remove friction and add value.
>> Yeah. And since I've gotten to know you and your business over
the last many months, I think your background's perfect for creating clear leadership
and having a vision, and not just a vision, but a vision that has
disciplined execution behind it.
And I think that's starting
to materialize itself.
And you had a really
exciting announcement, I think it was in the
beginning of November before your vision conference
where you crossed the $1.
25 billion of valuation
mark, right, unicorn status, if you will, and partly I think fueled by your agentic AI strategy.
So when you step back, what
do you see as the real drivers of this valuation surge?
Is it AI?
>> Yeah, I think that's a good question.

[06:13]
At least internally, and maybe
I'm underappreciating kind of the outside in view of this, but internally, nothing
ever felt like a spike.
It's felt like maintaining
the strain for a lot of years.
We've had this big vision
of what was possible, how we could deliver more and more value over
time for our customers.
And there have been big leaps
forward from technology, and certainly being able
to truly take advantage of the innovation that's possible through agentic AI has been
the biggest single leap forward that we've been able
to take to deliver more and more value to our customers.
But we've been really
fundamentally innovating and building on our product
for years, almost a decade now.
And the biggest leap forward
has certainly been agentic AI.
And as a company, we're
outside the Bay Area, we're in headquartered in
Wilmington, North Carolina.
We haven't been through
the many, many series of funding rounds that others have.
We kind of went about our work.
We bootstrapped the business
along for several years before raising outside money
for the first time in 2022.

[07:16]
And then recently, it's
a good moment to reset and see where we are and
capitalize the business further to continue to build for our customers.
>> Yeah, it was an exciting
month for you guys.
I mean, I tuned in for a little
bit of your conference down in San Antonio, right?
>> Yep.
- How did that go?
I mean, it really looked
like a great audience and a lot of really good content.
>> It was awesome. Well,
I'll say two things.
One, it's always awesome.
It's really fun every
year just to get so many of our partners and our customers
together, not only for us to make announcements
and share best practices and do all that stuff, but there's so much knowledge sharing,
especially right now where so many of these management
companies are doing really creative and innovative
things through technology and the peer-to-peer
sharing and breakthroughs and kind of just dispersion of
knowledge is awesome to see.
There's really creative
stuff happening right now.
And I think in particular for me,

[08:17]
what I realized this year is, a year ago, we announced at our Vantaca
Vision Conference in 2024, kind of the partnership of Vantaca and HOAI and the launch of HOAI within Vantaca.
And we were excited, that
was a big announcement.
But just a year later, that
has fundamentally changed how so many of our customers operate and really changed the
trajectory of their growth.
So, to see that happen in the
span of 12 months is exciting, inspiring, and has me fired up
to see what happens next year in November at Vantaca Vision 2026.
>> Yeah, and I encourage
everyone tuning into this, Ben had a great interview on
the New York Stock Exchange Wired program.
If you Google that, you'll go
out to a portal, you can see more financial-oriented
discussion about what's all been going on with Vantaca, but
really great conversation.
I encourage you all to go watch that also because I think this is
a real success story on

[09:18]
what it really takes to be successful.
And then, in light of being successful, I think you guys have just
reached over a million AI enabled workflows in
terms of execution, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah, and that
curve has been really fun to watch because a couple
things are happening.
And so, when we talk about
agentic workflows completed, it's a workflow that an agent
can go execute 100% of.
That previously a human
would've had to go in, and we've all used workflows
and software, and you go in and you approve things
and you select steps and you move to the next action.
So, being able to delegate
those results fully to an agent and have the agent pursue those results and get there on their own, we've reached over a million
unique workflows completed by agents now, which is super exciting.
So, there's two things.
One, more and more of our
customers are adopting these agents, but also our customers who had last January,
February adopted one,

[10:20]
are now adopting five, six, seven, 10 plus agentic workflows,
kind of workflow types that they can deploy agents into and go really remap big parts of how they execute work
in their back office.
So, it's a big milestone for us and we're seeing that accelerate.
It's kind of a doubling of the number of tasks almost every month
now that we're seeing, which is super exciting.
>> And what I love about you guys, which I think creates a
unique leadership kind of position for you guys is the difference between simple task automation, right, versus the sort of kind of
what I'm terming digital labor that your customers
are able to experience.
When I say your customers, being the management company personnel and probably the people that actually live in a homeowner
association, for example.
And to me, the difference
between a simple task automation, which is 100% repeatable, it's just coded, there might be some nuances
of what you feed in there,

[11:20]
but digital labor to me,
especially in knowledge work, there's got to be some degree of mimicking or predicting a judgment
to be made, right?
And so, how do you view the difference between simple automation and what your workflows are
able to do in that context?
>> Yeah. It's a really
fun thing to think about because if we go back, we talked about this at our
Vision conference in November.
If we go back less than 10
years, if we go back to eight, nine years ago, automation and workflow automation, that was it.
That was the cutting
edge of what was possible through software, and if you think about it, that's pretty interesting.
If with enough input data, you could say, "If this, then that.
" And you can react any
stimulus, whatever that is.
And really complex configurable
workflows like we've built in Vantaca are pretty interesting.
It can take a whole bunch
of different parameters and have a bunch of different
pathways that you can go down.

[12:22]
But I think at the end
of the day, you have to have a finite set of inputs and you have to be able to
put those things into a box for any kind of automation to happen.
It's simple if it's a yes or no, we'll go above
threshold, below threshold.
But as we all know, the real world and certainly the complex environment of managing communities across many states and then different geographies
with different rules and different unique circumstances and the people are all different, that's not a simple environment at all.
That's a very wicked
and complex environment.
And so, you have to be able
to apply some sort of judgment and reasoning and taste
almost to learn through that.
And what we've found is that
agentic AI can really do that much in the same way humans can, but agentic AI has this
advantage over us where it's hard for us to remember everything
that we've ever done before, and remember and instantly
access the thousands and thousands of pages
of unstructured data

[13:22]
that we would have to go look
something up and control F and find a keyword and read that paragraph and go link that back to something else.
But agentic AI can really do that.
And so, you can operate
in that wicked environment with speed and precision in a way that humans just aren't built to do.
And so, I guess that's like the kind of at least high level difference how I think about automation
versus agentic labor and agentic kind of work.
>> Yeah, no, I think that's right on.
And not only do we not
remember everything, I remember reading a book
on how the brain operates, and we do a lot of things
as humans that we don't, if you were asked to
explain why you did it or how you did it, you
wouldn't be able to.
It was like intrinsic, right?
And AI can kind of decode some of that stuff when done
in this agentic manner.
>> Scott, you said something that I haven't thought about
it exactly in this way.
It's kind of cool. We do a
lot of things based on our gut or based on instinct, and that's some reflection
of all this past experience,

[14:23]
and we've looked it up before and we remember that you
usually have to do these things.
And s,o with the right training and the right kind of trace
history of all this data before, agentic AI can sort of do that and operate with instinct
and reasoning and gut, but also with the precision
of perfect recall, which is pretty cool.
It's a pretty unique advantage.
>> Yeah, and then it learns from itself.
So, I think simple
automation, like provisioning a new laptop for somebody or processing something that
has a relatively small set of permutations and combinations,
right, is one thing.
But when you have, we're going
to talk a little bit later, I love the HOAI voice thing.
To me, you can't code what it may be asked and it has to make a judgment.
And the reason why I think this
is important is let me just show you one of the questions from our Agentic AI Futures Index, which is,

[15:24]
and this was about 625
pre-qualified either business or technology leaders in businesses that are already involved in agentic AI to one degree or another.
And when you ask about the next 18 months, what do they envision these
agents doing beyond automation?
You can see here, right?
Plan, which is formulate a
logical sequence of actions, or solve a problem which
starts with diagnosing and kind of understanding root cause and making the decisions.
And if you're going to make
a decision, you got to kind of explain it to somebody, and ultimately you want these
things to act autonomously.
Those are pretty big
numbers if you think about how early we are in the
agentic life cycle, right?
I mean, it's only been, what, a year, a year and a half or so.
And so, people have the vision
that I think you are starting to implement with your
customers, which is great.
>> Yeah, yeah. It's a blast.
And it's just the pace
of change is so fast too.
That's what's so much fun for us and so much fun for our customers.

[16:24]
>> Yeah. So, from your
vantage point, what happens to firms in your industry
that you're serving that don't adopt agentic AI?
With the digital labor mindset and all that stuff, what
happens over the next 18 to 24 months if they don't
move in this direction?
>> Yeah, it's a good question.
I think at times, when
you're in the middle of all this stuff
happening, it can feel like everyone's going to be here tomorrow.
There's this way to supercharge
everything we're doing.
I don't think it'll be tomorrow, but I think that 18 to 24 month, there is this seismic shift
that's starting to happen.
I think that when I look
at the last 12 months, I really think that true early adopters, and there are always
early adopters in any kind of technology wave, have
uncovered something.
And it's not just that it's shiny and it's interesting,
they've uncovered kind of a unique advantage.
And that's been fun to watch.

[17:26]
And it's still kind of this quiet thing where we're seeing folks
who kind of can't believe they're uncovering the
results they're seeing, and it is unique to them.
I mean, it's only a small
percentage of our industry and an even smaller percentage
of kind of the total services firms across
industries that have uncovered and unlocked these advantages.
But all of a sudden, when
it goes from two to five to maybe 10% of firms that are
really operating like this, that expectation at the
customer level will all of a sudden get reset up because they'll have been exposed to this, or firms will be competing
with someone who's doing this.
And then, I think it kind
of happens all at once.
And I think that's what we're
starting to see right now where everyone is aware
that this is out there and everyone's aware that they
need to be doing something.
And so pretty quickly, there's going to be this tipping point where it's going to go from there's those early adopters uncovering some unique results and a unique advantage to,
"Oh my gosh, we're being left

[18:28]
behind," and everyone is
going to have to rush to kind of transform here.
And so, I think that it's
sometime in that next 18 to 24 month window that
that moment happens, and the pace has
continued to blow me away.
It continues to accelerate, so
it could be faster than that.
>> Yeah. Actually, around
Thanksgiving, I was with a friend and we were taking a walk and it was in a homeowner
association complex, if you will.
And one house had all
the Christmas stuff up, and the group got into
a conversation about, "Well, I wonder if that's allowed.
" Right? With the HOA, and then another person
made a comment saying that, "They're worthless.
I call and I'm on hold with this agent, and it doesn't even
understand what I'm asking," and you get frustrated and hang up.
And I was thinking about you guys and I mentioned to them, I
remember the stats, right?
What is it, 27% of people in the United States
live in homeowners associations

[19:30]
or the sort of places that you're serving?
>> Yeah, yeah.
- And what were the other numbers?
I think it was like 40 million
of the, what are the numbers?
>> Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 30 to 40
million homes in community associations in the US.
There's both managed and self-managed, and that spans across HOAs, condominium associations, co-ops.
We're talking 75, 80 million
Americans just in the US living here.
Most residential real
estate that's being built and sold is in a community association.
So, it's a huge part of
our lives and how we live, and it's a huge part of the economy too.
And to your point, it's hard
for humans to handle that type of volume in these kind
of specialty firms.
So, it's a great place
for agents to go, again, just remove friction and add value.
>> Yeah. And they spend billions, right?
>> That's right. That's right.
- To get these things going.
So, you've outpaced your
competitors in both the adoption of this type of technology and obviously the valuation
that we talked about before.
So, you're outpacing at
a pretty rapid rate here.

[20:32]
So, what is Vantaca doing
differently that gives you that defensible advantage in agentic AI?
>> Well, I'll share a couple things, and I'll share a couple
ways I think we got lucky and a couple ways I think we've been good or at least been
aggressive in our approach.
So, I think that we really, when we built Vantaca,
not quite 10 years ago, we really built it in response
to what was limiting in kind of the prior era of legacy software.
Maybe there was some
integration with outside points, maybe some APIs, maybe some
workflows, but they were fixed.
It was a defined thing, not configurable.
Maybe there was some communication out, but there wasn't great
two-way communication in.
So, we really built Vantaca and architect it in the
early versions of Vantaca as a response to that.
So, configurable workflows
that can work the way you work, and can be different
association to association and firm to firm, and you
can add your unique flavor of service through
automated workflows, two-

[21:33]
way communication and integration.
All of those things have proved to be outstanding advantages in
terms of the infrastructure and the environment where AI and agentic AI can be really effective.
And so, once we realized how important and how game changing AI
would be for our customers and within the environment
of Vantaca, we went and said, "Okay, what else can we do to build the perfect
environment to take advantage of everything that is possible and everything that will
be possible in the future that we can't contemplate
yet with agentic AI?
" So for us, that meant
everything that a human could do through the software, an agent
has to be able to be equally as impactful, have access to
the same type of information, and really build first for agents and people equally, not agents
as a second class citizen or agents only with this workflow or only have access to these
unique kind of endpoints.
And so, we've spent a lot of time,

[22:34]
and especially in the last
18 months, invested a ton of product engineering resources
to build the perfect and curated environment for
agentic AI to be most impactful.
And so, a phrase that
you may have heard me say before is, we really think that we have to be UI first for people.
This is still a software that
people are going to need, humans are going to need
to go interact with.
But also API first, machine
to machine, integrated with outside systems so we can pull
in additional data sources, and also go out and interact
with additional data sources.
But lastly, AI first, where
agents can do as a first- class kind of user,
anything in the software that a human could or
could be done via API.
>> Yeah, and I think part of your story that I think is another great decision is you don't
require your customers to rip out what they already have, right?
You're just going to build upon it, and that's the impact first, right?

[23:35]
>> Yeah. No, that's right. And
what's really interesting too is the workflows, these
configurable workflows that were built to provide
automation for humans and to basically provide a path for humans to go make decisions and
inject kind of human reasoning and decisions into, created
the perfect guardrails to deploy agentic AI into to
say, "Hey, follow this path, follow this configurable
workflow, just as a human would go and inject human decisions and instead reason through
those decision points to get to an optimal result.
" So, that structure has
really been a unique advantage for our customers and unique
advantage for us to be able to deploy agentic AI into
the environment of Vantaca.
>> Yeah. We're going to
have to come up with a, at least I guess I'm going to
have to come up with a title for this podcast, but I like this idea.
I mean, what you've essentially done, and correct me if I'm
wrong here, is you re- architected the company for an AI first operating model, right?
It's a digital labor operating model

[24:36]
that you are essentially, that's what you're providing in terms
of value to your customers, and it's configurable and customizable.
It learns your unique environments.
And like you said, these
different associations operate differently and have different
ways of doing things.
And that AI-first operating
model kind of encompasses that, learns it, and then helps the humans be 10 times more effective.
Give them superpowers to do more for their homeowners, right?
>> That's right. And it's hard, again, I want to be transparent.
We were lucky in some ways that we had the right
environment to start.
I think with different
architectural decisions years ago, we'd be in a much tougher place.
We'd have to rebuild so much more, but we started with a
really great advantage of the environment and the
type of workflows, the type of infrastructure that we had in place to
take advantage of this.
And then, we've really gone
all in on creating kind of the ultimate environment
to take advantage of what will be possible as
agentic AI continues to advance.

[25:36]
>> Yeah. Yeah, I agree with you.
Well, could you give us
a concrete before and after example of digital coworkers and how they work with humans
to improve the outcome?
>> Yeah, absolutely.
Previously, Scott, we've talked
about the invoicing process.
I think something right now
that's particularly exciting to me is all things HOAI voice, which is a homeowner-facing agent that our customers, manage
companies, are providing as a service to their
customers, homeowners and residents within these communities.
And so, we've collected a ton of data since rolling this
out over the summer with many of our customers where we're seeing up to, in some cases, 90% reduction
in human time needed to handle phone calls and handle incoming
kind of customer volume because agents can so meaningfully go and handle these things.
I think the data that you
have on the screen here is a pretty good example.

[26:37]
There's some averages on the bottom there, and then there's a specific
customer that we went and kind of dug in on here.
So, pretty interesting.
We went from 4,000 calls being handled by humans in a month down to only 1,600, but the time is what's really important.
Agents were able to
solve so much of the time that we went from 800 human
hours on the left down to 66 human hours needed.
So, a reduction in four human months of labor time.
And those folks were not
just call center employees.
These were folks who
had the skills to go out and work with boards
and work in communities and deliver so much more productivity.
And so, not only is there
massive cost savings that these phone calls are
costing management companies so much less, but it's
also a better, faster and more accurate experience
for the homeowners themselves.
So, this is a great
transformational things where our customers are more profitable, and their customers are happier and getting a much better
service delivered to them.
And so, that to me is kind
of the ultimate win-win

[27:39]
with agentic AI where you
can increase your margins as a management company, but you're delivering
a much superior service to your communities and the homeowners and residents that you serve.
>> Yeah. One of the things, one of the mantras I've been on
is, I'm a believer unlike a lot of the pundits out there that
we look back three years from now or so, that AI is actually going to be a net job creator versus reduction in the overall economy.
And yes, some of the automation,
the purely automation- oriented kind of roles may go
away in a certain percentage of them, but it's going to get refueled by more knowledge worker kind of roles because there will be
more knowledge workers because AI is going to give them superpowers
and there's going to be...
The value's going to shift
from redundant automation to knowledge work.
And part of your story
that I've latched onto is, and again correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think what I've learned
is that your customers, that example went from five full-

[28:40]
time headcount, I think to 0.
4 or 1.4. But they're not
cutting people, right?
They're now having them deal with higher value things
like actually dealing with the people that live there, correct?
>> Yeah. It's been pretty neat, and I think we're pretty
lucky that we're seeing a lot of explosive growth for
our customers as well.
Our industry's going and our customers are really
winning within the industry.
So, most of our customers
are, one of the problems that they always have is, can
we find enough great staff?
And so, they're giving
superpowers to the team they have.
They're growing. They're
adding one, two, 10, 000 doors without having to go hire additional
employees on their team, but their employees are
so much more productive and so much more engaged in the community.
So, that's great. I think
there's certainly times where people have repurposed folks or when there's been turnover
on a team, they realize, "Hey, we don't have to backfill this role.
We aren't feeling the
strain of someone retiring or someone going out on
leave or something like that.
"
So, I agree with you, Scott.

[29:41]
I think there's also, there's
so much demand for better and greater service, and more consumption of more from management
companies in this industry that we're seeing our
customers deliver more services and just more value to these communities rather
than just reducing staff count.
>> Yeah. I mean, I think the
smart companies are going to take the cost savings and they're going to reinvest it to grow and to do new innovations and improve customer service,
as you were mentioning there, versus just take it for cost savings.
And I think those that just take it for cost savings are going to not do well as an aggregate going forward.
So, all this fear about
AI taking everyone's jobs, and I think past technology
transformations, it's likely to be a net provider over time.
>> Right.
- But we'll see. All right.
Well, last question here
before we have to wrap.
So, I always like to ask this question.
Looking ahead, right, and
you mentioned and alluded to before that you had your
2024 Vision conference with the big announcement of HOAI and you made tremendous progress,

[30:42]
and you just had your
conference last month, so in November of 2025.
So, look ahead a year from now and we're talking again, right?
What do these agentic community management systems look like, right?
The ecosystem, the customers.
In other words, where do
you plan to push next?
What's the next frontier
do you think you're likely to be talking about
next year at this time?
>> Yeah, I think we're already seeing a lot of this start to happen.
And so, I'll comment of
where I think it's going, but also what we're seeing right now.
We're starting to see that no longer are we having to...
So much of what a community
manager company does is respond to requests, a billing
question, an inquiry for this.
Instead of being reactive
to all these things, you can agentically go
meet these homeowners and residents with resolutions
at the point of engagement.
And so, kind of proactively going out and resolving these issues
before they become requests or before they become an email, before they become a phone
call, I think that's one thing.

[31:43]
And what we're starting to see the best and the most cutting edge
manager companies do is go and say, "Okay, well now, how can we enhance the
community experience?
How can we go deliver more to
residents in these communities that we never have before because we've been so
busy executing billing and answering questions?
" And so, I think there's a
lot more consultative community management that is starting to
happen to really help boards, help homeowners improve their community, invest for the future.
Think about proactively
what do we need to do to really proactively welcome
new people into the community and get them up to speed?
So, there's all this
goodness that's coming.
I think that effectively,
the kind of anchor that has always been the
back office repetitive tasks that have kept managing
companies from being able to do those things has really
been lifted in a lot of ways by being able to deliver so
much agentic resolution there, that we'll see a much higher
level of resident engagement, much higher level of proactive community
management across the board.
And we're seeing it now. I
think next year we'll be pretty

[32:45]
blown away by some of the gains that managing companies are experiencing.
>> Yeah, yeah. Well, Ben,
your story illustrates what I think is a critical truth, and I think we're likely
to see spread across pretty much all the industries over time, which is agentic AI just
doesn't transform a business until the business actually
wants to transform itself and sort of reimagine
what work really means.
And so, it's likely that the organizations leading
the next decade will be ones that shift from this idea
of it's about automation, to it's really about
knowledge-based digital labor and augmenting your humans
to give them superpowers.
And then from there,
those workflow sort of architectures evolve into
decision intelligence architectures where people
can make better judgments.
And I really think you guys at Vantaca and everything you're doing
under your leadership really stand out as an example
of that shift, right?
So, Ben, I really appreciate
you taking the time to join us today.
>> Yeah. Always fun.
Scott, thank you for having
me. Enjoyed the conversation.

[33:46]
