# 25. The Widening AI Value Gap — How to Close it Before its Too Late

**Video ID:** zNuZ9sADgXA
**Channel:** SiliconANGLE theCUBE
**Duration:** 34:05
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNuZ9sADgXA

**Module:** Agentic Workflows & Orchestration
**Module Rationale:** The video primarily focuses on agentic workflows, the integration of different AI capabilities into end-to-end automated processes, and how organizations structure workflows for AI success

## Summary
- Only 5% of companies are capturing real measurable value from AI investments, creating a widening AI value gap that may become impossible to close
- Future-built companies invest 25-50% more in IT budgets and 100%+ more on AI initiatives compared to laggards, resulting in 3-5x better results
- The evolution of AI follows three stages: predictive AI (45% of current value), generative AI (38%), and agentic AI (17% currently but expected to dominate future value)
- True agentic AI combines predictive models, generative AI, and automated workflows, not just simple GPT implementations that many companies mistakenly label as 'agents'
- Shared business-IT ownership delivers 1.5x better results than IT-led or business-led initiatives alone, making organizational alignment critical
- Companies with advanced AI capabilities can scale workflows twice as fast, creating a compounding advantage through accelerated learning and deployment
- The technology is moving at 'warp speed' unlike previous cycles, making delayed entry potentially catastrophic for competitive positioning
- Future-built companies focus on fewer use cases but execute them more thoroughly, building reusable capabilities and institutional knowledge

## Key Takeaways
- **DO:** Start immediately rather than waiting - the gap is widening and compound advantages make catching up increasingly difficult
- **DO:** Establish shared business-IT ownership for AI initiatives rather than siloing them in one department
- **DO:** Focus on fewer use cases but execute them thoroughly to build reusable capabilities and institutional knowledge
- **DO:** Think beyond task automation toward knowledge worker augmentation and digital labor transformation
- **DON'T:** Don't mistake simple GPT implementations for true agentic AI - real agents require integrated predictive and generative capabilities
- **DON'T:** Don't treat AI as just an IT project - it requires cultural transformation and cross-functional collaboration

## Key Moments
- [04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNuZ9sADgXA&t=245s): Only 5% of companies have figured out AI infrastructure and deployment at scale with measurable results
- [08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNuZ9sADgXA&t=491s): Most companies claiming to deploy 'agentic AI' are actually just using simple GPT tools - real agentic usage is only 5-10%
- [19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNuZ9sADgXA&t=1168s): Shared business-IT ownership delivers 1.5x better results than single-department leadership of AI initiatives
- [22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNuZ9sADgXA&t=1353s): Survey data shows 85% of organizations still assign AI implementation primarily to IT/data science teams rather than cross-functional teams
- [27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNuZ9sADgXA&t=1664s): Key advice: don't wait to start - this is a wave that requires commitment to learning and building capabilities over time

>> Hello and welcome back to
the next frontiers of AI, where we explore the strategies, the innovations in the real-world
story shaping the future of enterprise AI.
I'm Scott Hebner, your host,
principal analyst at AI for theCube Research.
Thanks for joining us.
This podcast is about staying current with where AI is truly heading, because unlike past technology cycles, this one is moving at warp speed.
And if you fall too far
behind, you may never catch up.
In my 35 years watching technology cycles, going all the way back to
the client server days, I've never seen anything with
such transformative power or the potential for disruption
than what I've seen with AI.
We're entering the
golden age of AI agents.
And it isn't just another tech cycle, it's a workforce cycle,
a human capability cycle.
AI isn't just about automation
or doing things faster

[01:01]
or being more productive,
that's just a starting point.
It's about digital labor,
giving people new superpowers to create, to reason, to
solve complex problems and to make better decisions.
And as I have always said,
organizations don't do things.
People do. And the promise
of AI is about amplifying what people can do cognitively.
Over the next five years, this shift will fundamentally
change how businesses operate, create value, and engage the world.
Yet too many leaders are
still sitting in the dugout, they're watching, they're
waiting, they're studying, they're thinking, yet the
game is played on the field.
So it's not that surprising that the AI value gap is widening, but what matters most now is how to close it before it's too late.
And we couldn't have a better
guest from a better company to dive deeper into this topic.
And he comes armed with
a new study involving 1,

[02:01]
250 global senior executives and AI decision makers across
nine industries in more than -five sectors.
It's a goldmine of insights.
So with that, I'm thrilled to
be joined by Vladimir Lukic is the global leader of tech and digital advantage practice
at Boston Consulting Group, and he's going to help
us unpack all of this.
So how's goes it?
>> It's great. Good to see you, Scott.
>> It's good to see you too.
And I appreciate you taking the time to join us today.
I assume you're up in Boston?
>> I'm up in Boston.
Charles kept me home
today, which is great.
It's rare, but I'm excited.
>> That's good. It's starting to get cold, certainly here in Connecticut.
All right, well let's
start with some background, really your background.
Could you just tell us a
little bit about your personal journey that led you to where you are now at the
Boston Consulting Group and a little bit about the
widening AI value gap study

[03:01]
that you and your colleagues just put out?
>> Yeah, so happy to. So I've
been with BCG for 20 years.
I've started our analytics
team some 15 years ago with a number of my colleagues that we've incubated from
essentially 0 to now 5, 000 colleagues that are data
scientists, data engineers, architects, full stack
developers, folks that build and deploy AI systems at scale.
So it was a fascinating journey
from being few folks in the corner that were hiding and figuring out how to
get budgets to get a server to build some of the solutions,
to now really being the team that we are, trying to
turbocharge even more and scale even more of a large size.
And boy, what a journey it has been.
And to your question now, in
parallel to that, we've been studying companies that
deploy digital and tech and now more recently
labeling as AI technology.
And there's some interesting patterns that we've been picking up on.
One is that there's still
only 5% of the companies that have figured out
their tech infrastructure

[04:05]
and how to deploy that scale
and have results to show for.
And that doesn't mean
others haven't been trying, but it's not the easiest
thing to pull off.
And the other interesting
thing that is important for everyone to be
cognizant of, if those 5% that have figured it out
are delivering results that are outsized compared to the peers, and the gap is widening.
And it's starting to become harder and harder to catch up with them.
And the silly thing I
keep using is for you to have five years of
data that's quality data, you still need those five years.
So if you didn't start on the journey, you'll always need those
five years to get to that relevant data set.
And the leaders have really
leaned in a while ago and they're now just starting
to compound their advantage and it's starting to bear out in all the
data we're looking at.
>> And I guess that's
the title of the study, the widening AI value gap.
And before we dive into
the details of that, because I think we want
to get into it much,

[05:07]
much deeper than 5% is a very
small number obviously for what three or four years
of at least generative AI, and then going before that
with predictive models.
But I always like to start
with some of the good news.
And I found some encouraging
news, I think, in the study as I read through it around agentic AI.
And what you found is
there's a lot of belief that it is going to
really expand the value that people can get out of
their investments in AI.
And let me bring up a chart here that I pulled from the study.
Maybe you can explain it a
little bit for our audience.
>> Yes. One can debate
the words, et cetera.
But what we are seeing in the study when we roughly try to break the use cases
that are being deployed and we try to them between predictive traditional
classic AI prescriptive optimization models that are
used for scheduling, pricing, et cetera, 45% of the companies would say

[06:09]
that value will come from those today.
38% of them say it's going to come more from the generative AI thing.
So our ChatGPTs that we use or there's a number of tools
used that cover different mediums and that would be the next wave.
And then only 17% would say
the value will be coming from the agentic deployments, which
is more integrated workflows that are both generative and
predictive are pulled together into more end-to-end automated place.
Now, as we look forward, the obvious trend and where the money is going
is that people will be, as they put in place, all the components
they need around predictive and generative will be
evolving more towards more agentic place.
And they really believe that the value unlocks will be happening from deploying those.
That will be at a rough level
how I would describe it.
>> Yeah. One of the things I
love about what you did on that chart in the study
is that you broke out

[07:11]
predictive versus
generative versus agentic.
And with the engagements I do, and have been doing a ton
of them over the last couple of years, I sense some confusion about the difference between those.
And I see a lot of people out there saying
they're building AI agents and they're building agentic workflows, yet they're relying
solely on generative AI.
And I'm not so sure that's truly possible.
It may be a good starting point.
You really do have build
around generative AI.
Generative AI is the gateway
into the world of AI, like the browser used to be the gateway into the
internet some 25 years ago, for enterprises they
got to build around it to get specialized capabilities.
And so could you just give us a little bit of your thoughts on how you differentiate
generative versus predictive versus agentic?
>> Perfect. And you
described it really well.
It's interesting. We just did
it a separate study for one of the clients where we've
asked them actually for one

[08:11]
of the tech players asking several hundred tech leaders what is the volume of agentic AI that they have deployed
versus generative AI, more of using the apps, when they
look at their use cases.
And they said that 40% of what they're deploying
is actually agentic AI, agent AIs, right?
And so we asked them then to describe what is actually what they've done.
And then when we've deciphered it, a lot of it was just they built a
little GPT for themselves.
And for them that was magical and agentic.
So when we took those out, the real number was
really in the 5 to 10%.
So to your point, I would say 80% of use cases out there that people describe as agents really are just small usages of the tool that exist
either from the predictor, it's a feature in their
favorite core piece of software, or it is a feature

[09:12]
or a set of steps that they've
automated in their favorite LLM or gen AI tool that they call agentic.
So that's the mystique out there.
And when you de-average for
that numbers look much more as what we've shown on this slide.
But that's as the backdrop to just underscore your
point on the confusion that's out there, which is fine.
Because there's a lot of folks who the gen AI was an entry
into the wonders of AI.
And to your point is the user interface through which they can start engaging.
But once you get into the deployments, the agentic AI really is the
combo, all of those things.
It is steps that are done by the traditional software
tools in a prescriptive way with known answers yes or no, and very precise steps that are then usually human interpreted.
And based on that, suggested
some next steps which now you can actually put gen AI into do.
And then the human trigger, the next step, which would also usually
prescriptive executable set of steps, which now gen
AI can trigger if you

[10:14]
let it do that.
And so the combo of those two and sub creating these
agentic workflows somewhere, it's also triggering and robo
process automation step,, RPA step that is pulling on some of the existing rules that exist.
But the combo of all of
those is usually a gen AI or AI agent.
And the human control there is deciding on the degrees of freedom that we let the engine to
make the final decision and trigger the next action, which is fully in the human control.
And that's where I see a lot
of companies are struggling with figuring out what is
the level of that automation and independence that are
going to allow into the agents.
Does that resonate? Does that help?
>> Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense and it's very consistent
with my point of view on it.
I think a generative AI and LLMs basically have created
the notion of an assistant where it can help individuals, it can help people be more
productive in automating tasks,

[11:15]
whether it be creating content or provisioning a piece of
software or something like that.
But agentic, an AI agent, gets
you into the world of more of a collaborative partner
where it's helping you reason and figure out root cause and problem solve and make decisions.
And it becomes a little bit
more of a collaborative partner to do knowledge work and things of that nature, which means you need
more than just an LLM as things like chain of thought
are starting to come out there.
There's knowledge graphs,
you mentioned the ability to integrate with RPA and other systems.
Then I think agentic AI is
when you start wiring all that together into a
collaborative workflow, right?
>> Correct.
- I think we got to be, people that are in our positions,
particularly you guys just keep reinforcing that agentic
AI needs to mean something.
And I think it does. And
obviously we're in the early days, there might be a little bit
of confusion around that.
And I think the way you framed
it in the report is right on.
It was very clear what the value is.

[12:18]
>> Yep.
- All right, well let's move into the gap because I'm want to get into
this in much more detail.
And let's start with the big picture here.
As you pointed out before,
your global study showed that despite years and years of invest, only 5% of companies are capturing
real measurable value from AI.
So tell us a little bit
about what's behind the gap, and I'm going to bring up
what I consider to be one of the summary charts in your
report that sets the framework or sets the context for the
rest of what we'll talk about.
>> Yeah, so listen, when we talk about the companies, what we found is they self- assessed on the components
of their AI muscle.
And that means is our data ready?
Do we have the right plumbing
and systems in place?
Do we have the right
infrastructure in place?
Do we have the right operating model

[13:21]
to do things the right way, et cetera.
And within that also a
number of questions around how much did they spend on
IT budgets, on tech budgets, how much did they spend
on those capabilities?
And there are a few interesting
things that came out, which was when we looked in 2024, which is what you see on the left-hand
side, those companies that were higher indexed
on those points, so they had higher level of
sophistication on the data, on the tech infrastructure,
on the operating model, et cetera, had three to five times higher results either in the revenue increase or on the reduction of the
cost, which you see on the left- hand side versus the laggards.
And then when we moved
over to 2028, we see that that gap is still there.
They are delivering much
higher increases in revenues and they're delivering much higher reductions on the cost side.
And what you see in the middle
is what explains a lot of it.
On average, companies typically spend 5%

[14:22]
of their total revenues on IT budgets.
When we looked at those
future bill companies, they spent 25 to 50% more on IT budgets
than the laggards.
And on average they spent 100% plus more on AI related initiatives.
So they're investing money, but we are also seeing results
are directly following.
So you need to commit to the motion and you need to actually spend
on it in a very focused way.
The other pattern that doesn't
emerge on the page is they spent more but they
focused on fewer things.
They were much more surgically
focused on where the value is and then they stuck with
those plays for much longer.
Those are a few insights
that are coming out now when we look at it through time.
>> Yeah, I think it's a
pretty compelling case.
And you're right, you
got to spend to invest.
It's the whole idea that
the game's played in the field, not in the dugout, right?
>> Correct. There you go.
>> And I do think, and you
alluded to this, that you got

[15:22]
to be careful on my cloud and maybe mobile and client server and all the things, the
internet e-business, there was okay to sit back and understand what's
happening, what I can do.
But today, man, you might
fall behind, not catch up.
>> Yep.
- Because everything's so rapid.
So I got another odd
chart that I really liked that I was intrigued with
that talks about the future- built cohorts, not just
investing more in AI, but the way they're actually
deploying AI-driven workflows.
And the fact that they're
able to scale that double.
And I'll bring that chart up for you to provide some commentary on.
I found this really interesting because, again, this goes
to our discussion a couple of minutes ago about
generative versus agentic.
These guys seem to be putting
it in the AI into the context of the workflow and they're having success and they're learning and therefore able to do things even quicker.

[16:24]
>> And they build a muscle, they can essentially take a pipeline of use cases and let's say both you and I have a hundred use
cases in our pipeline in your future builds and I'm a laggard.
What you would see in my pipeline is the bottom part of this.
Well, we are talking about 23,
but we're not doing anything.
We have 34 that we've planned around and we are starting to
think about what we do.
We're piloting around 30 of them.
We are scaling only 11 and we only have one
that's fully deployed.
On my end. On your end for those 100, there's only three left in the
pipeline of not being adopted and we're planning only for eight.
We are so farther along
in the funnel where you've already deployed
20, you are scaling now 40.
And so it just shows you how
much more mature they are and it takes a while to go through this.
And then the trick is as
you move more to the right, there is more learning.
So you get even better at thinking through what gets in the pipeline and how to do the planning the right way.
So they're further along on the journey

[17:25]
and they're incorporating those lessons and it just takes a while.
I have a number of clients that have deployed some solutions.
They've built them, took them 18 months, and then software company released it as a feature in their tool.
And they're like, "That's okay.
Because we just changed the processes, we got the data ready,
we can now use this tool.
" We would've still needed those 18 months to be able to use it.
So they're compounding that advantage.
>> And that's a virtuous cycle
I think you guys talked about, which is you start to nail the
techniques, you get the code, you get the experience, you're
building the skills, you fuel that with the fast pace of new innovations coming on the market, and then you're able
to adopt those quicker.
And that's the notion of the warp speed and being careful that if you
enter too late, you're going to find yourself at a very
distinct competitive disadvantage and may not be able to catch up.
And I think the 5% statement,
which I think MIT came out with something similar,
very similar numbers.
Correct. Yes. And we've seen it in some of the stuff we've done too,
where getting the value out

[18:28]
of it is tough in the enterprise, beyond individual productivity.
All the good things
that generative AI does, and a lot of these companies
have had predictive models for a while, but it's
moving so quickly now and so much investment's going
in across the world on new innovations, it's going to be fascinating as this thing moves forward in time here.
>> Correct.
- So the punch line, I think of the whole thing, again, I'm taking that from my read on it, was it suggested that companies have shared that
have actual shared business, IT ownership are far more likely to get the results they want.
And that alignment is so, so critical.
In other words, Lou Gerstner
at IBM when he did the turn around a long, long time
ago, said something like, "I thought culture was part of the game, but it turned out to be the entire game.
" There's a lot of organizational
transformation that has

[19:28]
to happen to make this all successful.
And I think this chart in your
report, and I took two charts and put them on one,
hopefully that was okay.
But I think you make a couple
great points here on the left about people and organization and process being 70% of
the game to be successful.
And then you can talk
through the other side.
And I actually have some data
from our Agentic AI Futures Index that supports, I
think, your point here, but I'll let you make the
point first and explain it.
>> No, the point is what you
see in the middle here, when we move from companies that
are in the stagnating motion to the ones that are future
built, the biggest difference is that this is not an IT project and it's not something that you
hide in your business budget to just do as a shadow investment.
It is when the two teams are equally owning it and driving it.
And it truly becomes a
business led tech supported at scale motion that
is rewiring the culture of the firm, and it's not a one-off thing.

[20:30]
So this is extremely powerful message that I do think all the
leaders need to absorb.
>> Yeah, 1.5, that's a
pretty big multiplier.
And if you start thinking out a little bit and we start evolving beyond just the agentic technology and what you can do with
it, you start thinking with the mindset of digital labor transformation, integrated workforces, people like Mark Benioff
at Salesforce saying that he's going to be the last leader to manage a human-only workforce.
And you start thinking in that
context, it's like, okay, so how do you not have the
business units involved, HR involved, you have to have your risk and compliance organizations involved and it can't be just an IT- led initiative. Correct?
>> Correct, correct.
And that's the big shift because a lot of companies
that are in that step before they're in the scaling

[21:31]
but do not become truly AI
future-built is exactly that.
They might have started with a business, but then they're saying, okay,
now it's IT thing to scale it and manage it and then they abandon it.
And a lot of these things just die, because it's not in the budget.
It's not spec'd in. So if
it's not jointly managed, then we jointly make the
interventions in the process.
It doesn't fly. So that is a
very obvious set of statements, but it's important for
people not to ignore.
>> So we ran, not as
comprehensive obviously as yours, but we ran what we call the
Agentic AI Futures Index.
It was 625 pre-qualified AI business and technology professionals.
It was in UK, Canada, United States, spanned 13 industries.
And let me show you one of the questions and one of the answers here that I think supports
what you just said here.
So which part of your
organization will be primarily accountable for implementing
digital labor strategies?

[22:33]
There's a similar
question using agentic AI instead of digital labor.
And it was pretty much
the same answer here.
But look at this, right?
Vlad, it's 65%, is it and app dev, another 20% is your AI team or your data science.
Only 8% said it was shared
cross-functional, printer of excellence, a board. That's startling.
>> This explains that only 5% get it right.
Because even this tells you that only 8% of them are even focused
on getting it right.
By definition, this is
what drives the outcome that we are seeing, right?
They're focused on, I build data science
teams and data engineers.
That is the core of what I do.
You don't ask that team to
go and deploy gen AI tools.
They're never going to let any of them get on the shop floor.
Because I am proud that
my team will deliver tools that are 99.
9% accurate and precise.
They don't go and deploy gen
AI tool that's only 70% right

[23:37]
and hallucinates 30% of the time.
No way that ever makes
it to the shop floor.
Forget about the fact that humans make it right
only 50% of the time.
So if you focus on the
wrong team to deploy stuff, it's just not going to happen.
And so this data also
nicely underscores one of the root causes of why
this stuff is not scaling up and making it to the front lines as fast as it should, and it could.
>> Yeah. And you had some
data in there too, I think, if I remember correctly on CAIOs, the chief AI officers are the more and more companies putting that in.
And I have some good
conversations with quite a few firms and end user customers
about the CAIO evolving over time to also take on the role of the digital HR. .
>> Yes. By the way, since you and I talked, and since that was published,
I talked with the CIO who said, "I'm now CIO and CHRO together and we've changed my title
from CIO to CIO" I said, "Okay, well what does that mean?

[24:37]
" And he said, "I used to be
chief information officer, I'm now chief intelligence officer.
" Now it has the military connotations, but if we can put that
aside, he's like, "I'm here to combine the human and the AI together
into a new intelligence and to drive the firm forward.
" And I'm seeing more and more of that mindset being proliferated, which is also brings to
life the whole point.
>> Yeah, absolutely. Let me put what I just showed you in
context, in the index that we did, we had these maturity indexes.
So if you look at aspiration,
so this was a set of questions around the rise of digital labor.
And it was 73% either strongly agreed or agreed that...
The one question was about do
you agree with the statement that you're going to
be the last to manage a human-only workforce?
And there were other related questions.
So it was a 4.1, which is high.
And actually I guess it was
71% said it was inevitable.

[25:39]
That was the agree or strongly agree.
When you look at strategy, the other thing I found
interesting here is the strategy, to your point earlier about
the evolution of generative AI to agentic AIs, it's now
more about knowledge workers where people that need to make judgments and they need to make decisions and they're trying to plan things and they need that assistance
to do that more effectively, faster, more accurately.
So they're prioritizing the future.
And this is the next 18 months
was the question to build out that knowledge worker capabilities, not just task automation or
not just workflow automation, but infused as you said,
intelligence, which is maybe what a chief intelligence officer does.
Because that always
involves humans and agents.
But then the question you just
saw on the previous chart I showed, then you look
at execution and it's 1.
8. So basically what you
got here is a huge gap between aspiration and vision, starting to put a strategy together, which is good.

[26:41]
But then when it comes to
execution, it ain't going to work as you said, because if it's
just your IT organization that's driving all that stuff.
>> Correct, correct.
I love when the data supports
the conversation, right?
That's exactly what's going on.
>> And two different surveys.
I know you guys as we do too, but you're probably on a
definitely on a much bigger scale, talking to a lot of real
customers that are doing things.
>> And the magic will
be in those who manage to turbocharge the humans and give them the new
superpowers in an effective way.
>> Exactly. Versus just say, "Hey, you can create content
better or whatever." >> Correct.
>> All right, cool. Well
look, before we wrap up here, let's talk a little bit about
where this is all heading.
Looking ahead here as
agentic AI becomes a larger and larger share of the investment and of the enterprise
values you pointed out, what would your advice on,
if you were looking at a year or two years, what are the key
things that leaders that want

[27:44]
to stay ahead of the curve or at least keep up with the
curve should be looking at both in terms of technologies,
best practices, maybe start with your state.
What would we be talking
about two years from now if we did this again?
>> Yeah, listen. Well, the
first point is don't wait.
This is a wave coming at you.
So take the surfboard, go
out there, it's hard to learn to surf, but once you learn
it, you can actually be on it.
But it takes a while of trial and error.
And then the waves are
going to come and go, right?
But you need to commit to the motion of doing that as a craft.
The gap widens and the advantage is
compound as you lean in here.
So the best time to start is now, right?
Because you just need to start
building a muscle, commit to it as a motion versus a project and you will figure out the kinks.
You will start asking the
right questions, et cetera.
But a lot of the folks ask
very advanced questions upfront and they didn't never get
started because of that, right?
They're very simple, low-hanging
fruit here you can do

[28:44]
to start deploying this technology and everyday operations, we
can then start building the common knowledge and the
right operating model.
So that would be the key
message. Get started.
And then if I look out two, three years, I genuinely don't know.
There's a lot of cool
stuff that will be unlocked with now quantum computing.
There will be a lot of new
things that will be unlocked with physical AI where
we are putting a lot of those brains onto the physical devices.
So there will be new
moments two years from now that will be different set of buzzwords that we will be dealing with,
but the underlying motion and the commitment to the operating model and augmenting humans with
this is what's going to remain.
So I think we would have
similar themes then, but just the tech might be different one that's a trigger for it.
>> Yeah. My take on all this is,
if I was thinking of themes, it would be bold, right?
Prioritize trust. People
only use things they trust.
And particularly if you're
doing knowledge work, think with a digital labor sort of
mindset, a co-worker mindset because ultimately these things
need to work in partnership with people, not just a SaaS application.

[29:49]
And then get out of the
dugout, man, start doing stuff, start experimenting, really take close looks at
things like you produced with your study and what
other people were doing, and just be aware.
>> Get more and get on the field, right?
>> Yeah. Otherwise you can run yourself into some problems here.
One last quick question, and I've given a lot of pings on this, mental pings on just what
I'm seeing out there.
And our study showed this
too, where there seems to be a shift as you look
18 months out to more and more investment on things that I guess would be classified
as reasoning, AI reasoning and decision intelligence.
Things like decision traceability, knowledge graphs for semantic
layers, causality, causal AI, causal inference, things of that nature that really start getting
you into the game of not just predicting what
the right decision is

[30:50]
and predicting how to explain it, but actually having more knowledge and decision intelligence in these agents.
Do you see that coming? Do
you hear a lot about that?
>> Yeah, for sure. That's a
natural progression, right?
It goes back to the beginning.
The degree to which we
let them act on that is where the difference
is going to be, right?
And some companies will have a higher tolerance versus lower.
But it's moving in that
direction, of them be able to connect those dots faster and having a stronger
point of view, if you will, and then acting on it.
For now still human is the
one that will interpret that.
I think we're going to see
progressively companies letting go control where they've seen
the effectiveness be in place.
But that is for me, a natural progression.
>> Yeah. One of the data points
in this area we did was, I think it was around 31% want to pursue, for example, causal knowledge graphs and things that understand cause
and effect and consequences and you can do what if analysis
and all that kind of stuff.
But when asked if there
were platforms delivered

[31:53]
and tools delivered that really
made it easier to do that, would you prioritize it higher?
And it jumped up to 47%.
So I think a lot of this
has to do with people making it easy.
Because some of the stuff gets really hard, right? .
>> Yep, yep, yep.
>> All right, Vlad, well
look, this brings us to the end of our time.
Thanks so much for being here.
Great insights and really
great work on this study to you and your colleagues.
>> Thank you.
- I know a bunch of you guys collaborate on that.
It was a really, really great study, like you guys always put out.
So again, thanks for being here.
>> Thank you. I appreciate it on behalf of the team. Thank you.
>> You bet. And the key takeaway, I think, for our audience here is clear if only 5% of companies are truly
realizing the value of AI and they're pulling ahead.
These future built companies have their finger on the right approach here.
And it's not just about
investing more, it's about re- imagining how work gets done.

[32:53]
Having bold leadership, having
the shared organizations that are driving all that, and I think they're inspiring, right?
I think they're giving us
the road into the future.
So anyhow, to dive deeper on
what we were talking about, make sure you go out to BCG's website and get the full report,
the Widening AI Value Gap.
It's a great read. And also
you can check out through me and our site, the Agentic AI Futures Index that provides some additional
information and data sources.
I think altogether it's
giving you a good roadmap on where this is all heading.
And make sure you subscribe
to the Next Frontiers of AI podcast.
We'll continue to explore where this is all heading in the future.
Until next time, I'm Scott
Hebner. See you again soon.
Take care everybody. Really
appreciate you being here.
