## Transcript Context
**Before:** what the agent figures out on its own now. >> Yeah. Very, very different, but incredibly powerful. And that's, again, why it's going to be a journey. Well, just if you recall, George,
**During:** let me bring up this chart.
**After:** We did a podcast, I think it was back in early February, the ladder to agentic AI. Just want to make everyone aware, if you haven't watched it, you can go back and get our views on just the high level
