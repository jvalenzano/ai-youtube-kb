# 10. A Blueprint for Scaling a New Agentic AI Business

**Video ID:** UpQoDiowH6Q
**Channel:** SiliconANGLE theCUBE
**Duration:** 40:48
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpQoDiowH6Q

**Module:** Case Studies & Lessons
**Module Rationale:** This video primarily presents a detailed case study of HOAi's success in building and scaling an agentic AI business, with specific customer testimonials, growth metrics, and real-world implementation examples

## Summary
- The agentic AI market for digital co-workers is projected to grow 45% annually through 2030, reaching $47 billion, creating unprecedented opportunities for vertical AI startups
- HOAi founder Haoyu Zha built a successful AI agent company targeting HOA management, growing from 10 to 60+ customers in just 4 months of 2025
- The democratization of AI allows startups to build 10x faster with significantly fewer resources compared to the previous cloud/SaaS era
- HOA management represents an ideal vertical for AI agents - it's desktop-heavy work requiring human judgment calls, managing 400,000 HOAs with 40 million homes
- Customer testimonials show dramatic results: one client saves $10,000/month in labor costs processing 10,000+ invoices that previously took 2-3 minutes each
- The evolution from predictive AI to generative AI to agentic AI enables real-world impact beyond just text generation - agents can execute tasks end-to-end
- Vertical AI represents a shift from the traditional 2-3% IT spend to targeting 50%+ labor spending in industries, creating 10x larger market opportunities
- Success strategy focuses on building on top of existing SaaS solutions rather than rebuilding entire tech stacks, leveraging domain expertise in overlooked niches

## Key Takeaways
- **DO:** Focus on vertical industries with heavy labor spending (50%+) and judgment-based desktop work that's ripe for AI agent automation
- **DO:** Build on top of existing SaaS solutions rather than rebuilding entire tech stacks from scratch
- **DO:** Target problems you personally experienced to ensure deep domain knowledge and authentic product-market fit
- **DO:** Design AI agents as digital coworkers that business owners can manage like human employees, with performance reviews and trust-building
- **DON'T:** Don't compete directly with horizontal AI solutions from big players like OpenAI - they can easily add features that kill horizontal startups
- **DON'T:** Don't try to replace existing customer solutions entirely - offer new value that wasn't previously available to reduce adoption friction

## Full Transcript

>> Hello, everyone.
Scott Hebner here. Welcome
back to the Next Frontiers of AI podcast, where we
feature industry pioneers who are shaping the future of AI.
Thank you very much for tuning in.
In this episode, we'll
explore what it takes to build and scale a new agentic AI business.
As we enter what many are
calling the golden age of AI agents, a new market
category is clearly emerging, one that's really going to
deliver on the growth demand that we're seeing for highly
domain-specific digital co- workers who can reason, act, and collaborate with humans
to enhance decision-making and accelerate outcomes and even act autonomously when
human involvement is either not feasible or warranted.
This market for digital co-workers and agentic workflows is
projected to expand 45% compounded through 2030, reaching 47 billion.

[01:01]
It's a massive new opportunity.
Today we unpack the blueprint for creating successful new businesses, tapping into the best practices that have helped a young company, HOAi, rapidly scale into a high- growth leader in the market
segment they're targeting.
According to the experts that spoke at the recent AI
Agent Builder Summit, hosted by SiliconANGLE and theCUBE, the playing field has
never been more favorable for starting a new business.
Innovators can now build 10
times faster, get to product and market fit sooner,
deploy products at scale, and fuel go-to market with
significantly fewer resources.
Unlike the world of
cloud and SaaS that came before this, where startups
needed massive resources to enter and lead in a
market, the democratization of AI has changed everything.
This is the dawn of a new super- cycle in business innovation,
one where vertical expertise,

[02:02]
fast iteration, and the use of AI-native
infrastructures can turn overlooked niches into billion-dollar categories.
To explore all this, I'm thrilled to have Haoyu Zha join us today.
He is a wide-combiner member and the founder of HOAi,
a fast-growing startup, harnessing digital
workers to help transform how homeowner associations
operate, create value, and engage their communities.
So thank you so much for taking the time to be here, Haoyu.
>> Thanks for having me.
- Let bring you up on the screen here.
There you are. How are you doing?
>> Hi. Good. Hi, Scott.
Thanks for having me.
>> You bet. It's been really interesting.
We're just coming off of
the AI Agent Builder Summit and we got into this conversation about what a great time it is
to be a startup, right?
And there was a lot of
discussion about sort of what I just said in the intro here about

[03:02]
the ingredients are all there
to create new marketplaces.
I'm excited to kind of get
into this conversation with you and then talk about your
business and what you've created and how you're scaling it as
a good blueprint for others to think about how they do the same.
>> Absolutely.
- So before we get started though,
just for our audience, tell us a little bit about
your personal journey to where you are now.
>> Great. Yeah, so I started this company about three years ago.
That was 2022.
Right before that, I worked
at a healthcare startup.
I was one of the early
employees, building AI for consumer healthcare technology, at which time I really
started thinking about how AI could transform our life and change every piece of
our life and experience.
I was also on the board of an HOA.
So I owned a home in an
HOA, went through all

[04:05]
the paying of being a homeowner in an HOA.
I sat on the board, saw everything, and just thought, "Well, this industry and this whole HOA management
operation are really needing something to make
it a better experience for homeowners, for
board members as well as for property managers who are struggling with managing these HOAs.
" So that's how I got started.
I started building a
software for my own problem and got accepted by Y Combinator, found some really good
investors, raised a seed round of funding, and kept building the software and really have been building in a space for the past three years.
Really found the product
market fit in 2024 when we started focusing
on the agentic AI space and using agents, building
AI agents to solve real-

[05:08]
life problems for the space.
>> For our audience that's not
familiar with Y Combinator, can you give us a little
bit of a background of what that is?
>> Yeah, so Y Combinator is one of perhaps the most successful
incubators in Silicon Valley and arguably in the world.
It has incubated a lot
of very, very widely- known names such as Airbnb, Coinbase, Stripe.
So these are all Y Combinator alumni.
And in fact, with OpenAI, Sam Altman was the president of Y Combinator, and OpenAI used to be the research or AI research arm of Y Combinator.
And then he started really working on it and incubating OpenAI
then left Y Combinator to focus fully on OpenAI.
So there were just a lot of successful companies
coming out of Y Combinator.

[06:12]
So we were fortunate
enough to be part of it.
>> Yeah, I know one other founder and CEO that went through that program.
And my understanding is
that they put you through your exercises, right?
It's not easy to graduate and become a part of
that whole organization.
So that's true, right?
You can't just join it.
You got to earn your way through it and get people to believe
in what you're doing, which is a big accomplishment.
Congratulations on that.
>> Yeah, thank you. That was great.
>> So let's just think a little
bit about the agentic AI marketplace, the marketplace
for AI, agents in general, which obviously you're tapping into.
From a business opportunity perspective, what makes it different
than the last few years of what you were able to
do with generative AI?
>> Well, I think generative
AI is the precursor of agentic AI.
I would really classify AIs as there is the predictive AI and then there's the generative AI,

[07:13]
and then the agentic AI is just kind of a natural progression
from this generative AI.
And in fact, the core
basis is generative AI.
So if we look back, we
had predictive AIs trying to predict weathers,
trying to predict fraud.
Those were usually very specific.
You had to train models and
get a very specific results.
Where generative AI deferred
itself is, it was able, for the first time, to be
one more general purpose and to communicate and
generating text or picture or even videos in a way that did not completely stem
from the past experience.
It's able to create new
things and generate things and generate very, very sophisticated and extensive results from it.
And then layering on top
of that, we leverage the

[08:17]
ability of generative AI to really think to reason through the
context, generate commands, thinking through texts
and other modalities and bring them with the tools and other systems that we have
today, whether through APIs where there's something
that's really popular lately that's called MCP, these other things to create real world impact.
That's how I think about agentic AI.
It's like you have the
generative AI doing work and creating real life
impact in the real world and doing more complex stuff.
So that's what agentic
AI is, in my .
>> Just to get your take on
one of my predictions, one of my AI predictions
for the year, which was the generative AI wars are going to end the same way the
browser wars did in the

[09:17]
early internet age.
And what I meant by that
is if you think back to that timeframe, the browser
was the most important decision you can ever make, right?
But what ended up happening
over time is it faded into the infrastructure and it
became a preference at best.
And those that essentially
creating a gateway into the world of the internet, the online world, and those that were most successful in
creating business value were those that built around and on top of that gateway
being the browser, right?
And that's where all the value came from.
So you make the analogy to what's happening
today is generative AI, I think it represents a
gateway into the world of AI.
It's democratizing the
ability for people to use it and does all the stuff you just mentioned.
The value is going to be when
you start to build on top of that as a core infrastructure service.
And I think that's
exactly what you're kind of describing here, is you're adding value through the notion of agentic workflows and AI agents that are able
to make decisions better,

[10:20]
they're able to plan and even autonomously and sort of collaborate with each other.
I think there's a good analogy there because there's so many people now that are really focused on generative AI and which one to go with.
>> Right. - I think it's time
to move up that value stack.
>> I would agree with that.
I think exactly to your point, I think the models, I would
focus more on the models, whether it's GPTs, Anthropic's models or even Google's Gemini,
Llama, whatever, you name it.
These models are critical
part of the whole ecosystem.
But they're probably, I would say, they're the foundation layer or they're the gateway to
a much bigger opportunity.
I deeply believe that the world is full of new opportunities and a lot of value will come from the
application layer, that is

[11:21]
to use these new technology and these foundational models and then apply them in real
life situations in different industries, verticals and exact use cases.
The reason why I believe that is, because I just think there are so many long tail situations and actual real use cases you
would not be able to pick up as a general purpose or generic model.
It's like, there are
infinite possibilities and infinite types of situations.
There's no way a foundation
model will be able to exhaust all the human
possibilities or interactions.
So there are always going
to be these industries or business industries,
business layers on top of these core intelligence layer.
And then where these
industries are, they're closer to end customers.
So that's where they can capture a lot of values in their unique
workflow, unique ways

[12:22]
of doing business, applying
these specific domain knowledge.
To summarize, I believe that the evolution of this technology is going to be that the foundation model is going to get smarter and smarter.
It's going to create so
much tailwind for all of these businesses, but they're going to be
just a foundation layer and, perhaps to some
point, get commoditized.
There are so many options and they may not defer
too much in capabilities.
And it's the business layer,
the application layer on top of them, building unique
workflows, unique use cases, unique interfaces, and solving for specific problems
that are going to capture more value in the next several years.
>> Yeah. That was the consensus of the 20 or so people that participate in the AI Agent Builder Summit, was that
is what you need to do, is agentic AI provides you a
framework with AI agents on to build on top of that

[13:22]
and just leverage the generative
AI foundation, the LLMs that make the most sense for you because over time the
value would be what you do.
Which kind of brings us to
the million-dollar question for you, which is, what
inspired you to start HOAi and how did you identify the
homeowners association market as the right to target with
an AI agent-based solution?
>> So several things.
One, I mentioned I was
on a board of an HOA, so that was just a personal
problem that I had.
It wasn't magic.
It was just, I happened to be there so I experienced it firsthand
and understood it very well.
But on the other hand, I
think this industry has something really unique.
This industry is pretty big.
There are about 400,000
HOAs in the United States, mostly run by volunteers, and that includes about 40 million homes.
And all of the new
homes, I want to say 70%

[14:26]
of all the new homes coming
to the market today are part of an HOA.
So it's pretty huge market.
A lot of people are involved, consumers and private management companies.
Many people are involved.
But it's highly inefficient and the experience is really bad.
If you go online or if you have a friend
who lives in an HOA, I would be surprised
if they are very happy about their experience.
In general, I see if I go online and find a HOA management company, I generally find Yelp rating below 3.
It's industry full of complaints.
So what that means is it just really
needs a better solution.
So that was kind of part of the origin why I had a personal pain.
The industry is big enough and has a low MPS, you would argue.
So these just mean it's
ready for innovations.

[15:29]
On the other hand, even
though HOA management is related to property
management, 90% of the work are actually done in the
back office, in front of computer screens.
The interesting part is these work are what I call desktop-driven tasks, meaning you can do things on a computer, but they rely on judgments, heavy reliance on judgment calls.
So what this creates is unique, because if it's
desktop-driven, meaning a lot of things can be done on a computer, that means it's ready for software.
But because it's reliance on judgments, it was not ready for traditional softwares where you could just code things,
deterministically if else, and exhaust all the possibilities because there are a lot of
natural language communication

[16:31]
among homeowners, vendors, boards.
There's a lot of unstructured
data, rules, bylaws, policies that require that level of
micro judgment by humans.
It's not hard stuff, but it's something that humans
need to read, understand, have that context, make a little decision where it should go, how should
I handle this situation.
So these characteristics
make it a really good fit for generative AI because generative AI is able to parse through all these
information making decisions like a human would do.
So combining these two, it's
computer-heavy, desktop-heavy, and then relying on
judgment plus the advent of generative AI, all of these elements coming together make
it a really great vertical for agentic AI.
So based on all of the reasons we started, we were working on it, and I
think that's why we were able

[17:33]
to achieve pretty good early success.
>> Yeah, I definitely agree
with you on the generative AI or the LLMs underneath the generative AI largely are predictive models, right?
They work on predictions and
correlations and patterns and data and all that.
And a prediction is not a judgment.
So to make decisions, you
need to make judgments, as you said, and that's
where I think some of that ecosystem on top of that
foundation starts to come in, which I know is a big part
of building these agents.
And I actually love your tagline.
It says, "Don't just chat experience AI that actually gets work done.
" And to your point, you
need to make judgments to get work done in most cases, right?
>> Yeah. And I think just
in addition to that, when we started using ChatGPT,
it was text in, text out.
You are getting answers most of the time.
But what agentic AI is focused on, and specifically what we're focused on, is creating real life impact
beyond just the tech space.

[18:33]
So it's like our AI would
help homeowners actually make changes or apply changes to
their ledger, charge their fees, waive late fees if necessary, or enter accounts payable invoices, facilitating the payments, dispatching vendors to fix things.
So all of those real life
actual impacts are happening.
I think that's where
agentic AI really shines.
It's creating, doing
tasks, getting work done beyond just giving you an
answer, which is very limited because if you think about
getting an answer, you still need to go around and do things.
So it's more convenient, but it doesn't solve
the problem end-to-end.
And agentic AI is meant to really get the work done end-to-end.
>> So for this target market that you had a personal
experience and need for, and you did your research obviously, and you saw that there's
a ton of these out there and they're not very satisfied
in terms of the community,

[19:35]
that the community's
not satisfied, so bring to life here a little bit of the value that you're delivering to
the homeowner associations and the communities that
they serve in terms of what is HOAi providing them?
>> Yeah, I think what would speak loudly is to see some of our customer testimonial.
I have a customer video and
maybe we can play it now.
>> Prior to HOAi's AP agent,
we were processing between 10, 000 and 15,000 invoices a month, each one taking two or three minutes.
Some taking research
that took much longer.
It was a very tedious
labor-intensive process.
Now with HOAi, those 10, 000 plus invoices are processed
accurately within minutes.
So I did a cost analysis
of before and after, and I'm saving approximately
$10,000 a month in labor costs.
We're really going to embrace
in a major way using AI to do budgets for the 2026 budget cycle.

[20:37]
I think I'll save literally
a thousand hours of time.
We have 600 plus budgets to do, each one taking about two hours.
I think we can get them
done, the draft budget, in about 15 minutes each.
Our 5-star reviews have gone way up.
The residents are calling with a question, they get a good answer.
We've seen great benefit
both from client satisfaction and from an efficiency point of view.
AI is going to transform our
companies, how we do our work, how we deliver our product.
It's going to allow us to
work smarter and faster.
It's going to optimize our results.
It's going to control our costs.
>> It's amazing. Those are-
- Yeah. So what- >> Yeah. Those are real numbers, right?
>> Those are real numbers. Yeah.
The person who appeared in the video, he is Peter Greaves, he's one of our early customers in the DC area, our primary customer.
We don't sell our AI agents

[21:39]
to the HOA communities directly.
We usually sell to the property or HOA management companies
who manage these communities.
So they are able to achieve a lot of these benefits in their
back office operations.
What Peter described was
one of the agents we had, or we have, that is the AP agent.
It's able to recognize invoices, understanding the GL codings,
checking historical ones, checking for duplicates,
verifying the numbers, doing all of these things that a accounts
payable clerk would do, and just using generative AI and doing it in an agentic way.
Like he was saying, he was able to save $ 10,000 a month.
And we've just seen a lot of
these real results among...
It's not one customer.
It's from tens

[22:41]
of customers we have.
So another customer I can
think of, repurposed half of their AP team after deploying our AI agency
in their AP department.
So it's just real tangible
results everywhere.
>> So you mentioned tens of
customers, 10 customers.
If I understand correctly, you
founded the company in 2023, so you're only a couple years old, right?
And that's some really great growth and scale, I think, just from
getting started, you know?
>> Yeah. So in the year
of 2024, by end of 2024, we have 10 customers.
Now, today is April 24th of 2025 so four months in, we've 6Xed our customer base in just four months of this year.
So that means we have about
60 management companies.

[23:44]
And that represents a total
of more than a million homes that were helping the
management companies manage.
>> What was the number again
of HOAs in United States?
Did you say it was ?
>> So there's 40 million
homes in the United States that are part of HOAs.
Today we have more than a million homes that we're helping these
management companies manage it.
>> That's great. And so, as
you think about scaling...
So I think what's unique is
that you've created a business.
And sort of like what
I said in the beginning that I learned from the summit we did, that the opportunities
in these, I don't want to use the word niche,
but very vertical spots that require unique domain
knowledge like an HOA, that's an incredible scale
since launching a business.
And I think a lot of it has
to do with just the fact

[24:45]
that it's a whole new market set of capabilities when you
get into these agents and agentic workflows.
So what are some of the
other growth milestones that you're looking at?
Obviously it's the acquisition of customers, their satisfaction.
I think having looked through your website and seeing a lot of this, you have a lot of really happy customers that have their minds blown almost, right?
>> Yeah. - What are you
looking at as we go through?
>> Yeah, so back to your point, I think it's with agentic AI,
we're really opening up a lot of opportunities that were previously not
available to software.
I think as a whole, software or traditional software
accounts 2 to 3% spend of overall business spending.
And then a lot of these industries and HOA management being one of them has heavy labor spending.
Other related that are similar industries or accounting, these things
can have heavy labor spending.

[25:48]
And in the HOA industry,
it's like more than 50% of the expense goes to labor.
So what agentic AI or AI agents are able to do
is tap into that spending, that part of your business expense.
So if you think about IT budget, that's maybe single digit
spending of your total P&L.
And your labor could be 50,
60, some higher, some lower.
But if you think about that, that's a 10X bigger market
opportunity for software.
So that just means
previously niche industries or industries that will
rely heavily on labor and have high labor expense
now become opportunities.
So we're able to tap into that.
This industry alone now
becomes a really, really lucrative opportunity.
So the industries that perhaps
previously are not great industry for software company

[26:50]
because they were a
labor-intensive, now all of a sudden become the most
lucrative opportunities because AI can tap into
that labor spending.
As a company, for us,
our goal for the rest of the year is to grow to double, triple, quadruple our customer account.
I think the market has the demand and we see that growth going there.
We just need to keep
delivering our products to meet that market demand.
>> Right. And so for you to get started, what's really different, tell
me if this is true or not, but my understanding is that
what's different from the SaaS era, software as a service, is you had to build a lot of the software.
The layer was sort of not at the top layer of the user interface, but it
was at the next layer, right?
Where now, like you said,
you're building off agentic capabilities off of the
generative AI foundation.
And obviously underneath
that is a cloud foundation.
So you're able to create a lot more faster

[27:51]
than perhaps in the end.
And I'm sure you're using AI to actually help you create your software.
>> Yeah, absolutely.
- And that's your fast  to the market. Yeah.
>> Yeah. And I think you start seeing a lot of these smaller teams creating
incredible growth within super short amount of time.
Obviously as software
companies, we use AI agents and these agentic AI
coding tools to help us deliver those things.
But on the other end, the
approach we chose was we're not rebuilding the entire tech stack.
We're building on top
of the existing SaaS.
So all of these industries have
their SaaS solutions today.
So we're really just building the people who are using these SaaS software.
It's a different layer of this tech stack that allows us not to
rewrite the entire playbook of the SaaS industry.
We're just standing on top of
the shoulders to the giants and then be able to provide
values that they were not able

[28:53]
to provide previously and solve a problem that is
deeply needed by our customers.
>> At the summit, I keep
referencing, we had Abdi Goodarzi, who is the lead generative
AI leader at Deloitte, and he made an interesting comment.
And I'm teeing back on your
comment about the labor, right?
>> Yeah.
- And he said the chief AI officer, they're starting to see that they're obviously more
than technology people.
They're business people.
But he was making the point that he's seeing more of their
big clients treating them as HR people.
>> Exactly right.
-  HR, because really what you're doing and what
the opportunity is here, and certainly what
you've done with the HOA community is you're really
helping provide coworkers that helping give superpowers to
the people that manage the HOA.
And to do that, you have to understand how people get work done, where it's just a little bit
different than automating tasks and stuff like that, right?
I mean, it is a different
way of thinking about

[29:54]
how you build a new set of
offerings for the market.
It really has changed the game, hasn't it?
>> I thinks so.
- Yeah.
>> Yeah, I think so. And
unlike building tools for the typical users to use,
I think where we add a lot of value is not only applying
the domain-specific knowledge and workflows to our solution, but also building the right
experience for the decision- maker, the business owners
to manage a team, a workforce of AI agents.
So we're a HR company, we're
a human resource company and providing these AI agents.
And I think a lot of value
to our product goes to how we create the right
experience so that the decision- makers can manage these AI
agents like they manage people.
How do they do performance review?
How do they understand the results?
How do they build trust and confidence?
How do they continuously improve them?

[30:56]
So that's a critical piece
I think we're all going to see more and more as this
agentic AI era comes to life because the basic getting
things done will quickly become commoditized too.
I think the next step is, how do you really facilitate
this change of management?
How do you bring digital
workers to your human workforce and transition certain function roles to this digital workforce and then facilitate that
experience is where we want to focus on a lot of our energy.
>> Yeah. I think you hit it on the head before when you said that
the old software market, let's call it the
traditional software market, you're building software that helps people automate the tasks that they're trying to complete.
Where now you're delivering
software agents that sort of start to understand how
you think, how you reason, how you make decisions and
becoming a true coworker or partner with, right?

[31:57]
And I think that's fascinating.
So where do you think this
is all heading for you guys?
What are you most excited about?
If you look a couple
of years out from here, where do you think you're
heading as a business?
>> Yeah, I think it's super exciting because our goal is to be able to basically relieve all the grant labor- intensive work for this industry.
So we're looking function by function.
So it's the accounting
department, the AP/AR, the financial productions, it's the customer service, these roles.
But our goal is really to look
at them function by function and trying to create AI agents and digital workers for
this vertical industry and then provide these workforce
or labor to the property or HOA management companies.
The great future we're seeing is, all of these work are done by AIs so that the business have better
margin, better results,

[33:00]
the homeowners are being served better.
And at the same time
though, I think the people that are working for these
companies today will all get elevated to roles where require
more interpersonal skills and just be relationship
builders, relationship managers.
And all of those work are
going to be done by AIs.
So that's exciting for us because our goal really,
when we look at the future or a few years down the road, our goal is to really provide that
workforce to the entire industry and be able to, in a way,
revolutionize this industry.
>> Yeah. I'm excited that we're talking because I mean, to me, this is
an incredible success story.
So congratulations to you and the team on everything
that you've done there.
I mean, it's such a short amount of time to have so much success.
I mean, I know a lot of
startups haven't worked at IBM for all those years, and
I've worked with a lot of startup type businesses.
It usually takes 5, 6, 7, 8 years

[34:02]
to actually build into 60 customers, for example, or whatever.
You're growing very rapidly.
It's a great, great success story.
So before we wrap up here, I want to just, if you don't mind, turn you
a little bit into an advisor, give some advice to those in
the audience that might be in this world or just
ready to get started.
Let me just bring up a chart here.
I did some research before we did this.
And what I found here is
the yellow is the growth in startups, AI startups
in the United States only.
If you go worldwide today,
it's closer to 70,000 that have been created
over the last 10 years.
So just looking at the United
States here, so almost 18,000.
It's still growing at the rate
that you see on this chart.
However, it's projected that
90% of them are going to fail.
And so, obviously you
got 17,000 startups that are focused on AI now.

[35:02]
They continue to grow at this rate.
How do the ones that
have already started kind of adapt a little bit versus
the ones that are just ready to get started now?
How do they think a
little bit differently?
I think you've given a
lot of good insights into that already, but I'm curious
to your views on that.
What would you tell someone who's looking to either start a new business
as part of a bigger business or a startup, they want to find and just get going with a business opportunity
that they see like you did?
>> Yeah, just from my personal
experience, I guess I have two humble thoughts.
One is I think vertical
industries are really interesting.
It's like vertical SaaS, to
now we're entering an era of vertical AI agents.
Previously, the industries
that previously looks small now may not be small.
So it's really interesting to
look into specific industries because horizontal
industries, big markets,

[36:04]
you always worry about what OpenAI or Gemini, these bigger
model providers can do.
A new feature they roll
out tomorrow might just kill a bunch of startups we were previously doing in those places.
But it's always going to be
hard for these big players to focus on the specific verticals.
There are just a lot of
very niche nuanced demands and requirements in these
verticals that the big, big players or big labs won't be able to spend or to focus on.
So that's one thing. Vertical
industry is interesting.
Look at small niches.
Don't underestimate their potential.
The second piece I feel
really interesting is to really focus on the macro trend and rethink what's needed.
Every 10 years in the
2000s, it's internet, PC .
and the 2010s, it's cloud and mobile.

[37:07]
Now it's really AI.
There are new software, new
interaction, new problems and new ways of thinking.
So we decided to build this, not to follow the traditional
software playbook to rebuild everything from ground up or repeating whatever that was already available
in the previous generation or already in the market.
We want to focus on things
that these softwares or existing solutions
don't offer or don't solve.
So that was our wedge into the market.
We don't replace people's current solutions, which usually
create a lot of pain.
We are offering new values that are previously not available and rethink about the customer experience and interaction with
software and AI in general.
So these two have been, what
I think, attributed a lot to our success.

[38:07]
>> Yeah, I think that's great advice because I think a lot of
these SaaS providers today are going to decompose and evolve to create
an agents out of them.
And they tend to be
more horizontal in terms of the big guys, right?
And the opportunity is
to really go vertical, domain-specific.
And like you said, there's
probably just an uncountable number of opportunities out there.
>> That's right.
- Who would've thought homeowner associations would be
such a big market here?
And then I think over time you
start getting these AI agent marketplaces that start to come up and you can start to
integrate these things together and you can tie things.
It really is a reset of the software marketplace going forward.
And the business value
shifts from automating stuff to helping people make decisions.
And it's about giving
superpowers to people.
It's about labor, to
even a greater extent.
It's really going to be fascinating as we go through time here.
All right. Well, look, I think
it's time for us to wrap up.
I can go forever on this.

[39:08]
I think it's been a
fascinating conversation.
I think it's been a great example of what you can actually do with
some focus, some discipline, and just you are showing
a lot of creativity.
A lot of it was based on
your real life experience, which makes it even better.
And great progress in just over what?
Just around two years or so.
So Haoyu, thank you very
much for being here.
I think this is a great
discussion actually.
I think it's a very
meaningful discussion for most of our audience.
And I wish you the best. And
keep us up to date on progress.
I'm sure we'll have more
conversations going forward.
And for all of you out
there, thank you very much for tuning into this.
There's no doubt that
agentic AI is reshaping how startups launch,
scale, and deliver value.
And as I said up front here, and we heard at the AI
Agent Builder Summit, we're entering a new
golden age of AI agents.
This opportunity is clearly
not theoretical. It's real.
It's growing. It's available
to those with clarity of vision

[40:09]
and the urgency to act.
So make sure you do check out the recent AI Agent Builder Summit.
You can go to thecube.
net or our YouTube channel
to get access to that.
And I really do appreciate
you all for tuning in.
Take care and we'll see
you on the next episode of the Next Frontiers of AI.
Bye for now.
