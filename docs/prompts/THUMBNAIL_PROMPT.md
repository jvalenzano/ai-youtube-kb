# Thumbnail Design Prompt for Nano Banana Pro

## Best Practices Applied

**YouTube Thumbnail Best Practices:**
- High contrast with bright, saturated colors
- Large, bold text (minimal words, maximum impact)
- Clear visual hierarchy with focal point
- Show transformation/result (before → after)
- Use arrows or visual flow to guide the eye
- Include numbers/stats for credibility
- Professional but eye-catching design

**LinkedIn Thumbnail Considerations:**
- More professional aesthetic (less "clickbait")
- Clear value proposition
- Readable at small sizes
- Brand-consistent colors

## Primary Prompt for Nano Banana Pro

```
Create a professional, attention-grabbing thumbnail image (1280x720px, 16:9 ratio) for a GitHub repository that transforms YouTube playlists into AI-powered knowledge bases.

VISUAL CONCEPT:
- Split-screen or transformation flow showing: YouTube logo/playlist on left → AI processing (glowing neural network or magic sparkles) in center → Searchable knowledge base interface on right
- Use a modern, tech-forward aesthetic with gradient backgrounds (deep blue to purple, or teal to cyan)
- Include subtle code elements or terminal windows in the background for developer appeal

KEY ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE:
1. Large, bold text at top: "1-Click YouTube → AI Knowledge Base" (white or bright yellow text with dark outline for readability)
2. Prominent stat badge: "2 Weeks → 2 Days" (onboarding time reduction) in a bright accent color (orange or green)
3. Small feature icons arranged at bottom: transcript icon, slide extraction icon, NotebookLM icon, RAG search icon
4. Subtle "AI-Powered" badge or glow effect to emphasize automation

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Deep blue (#1a1f3a) or dark purple (#2d1b4e) background
- Accent: Bright cyan (#00d9ff) or electric blue (#0066ff) for highlights
- Text: White or bright yellow (#ffd700) with dark outline
- Stats: Orange (#ff6b35) or green (#00ff88) for impact numbers

STYLE:
- Modern, clean design with subtle depth/shadow effects
- Professional developer tool aesthetic (not cartoonish)
- High contrast for visibility at small sizes
- Minimal text, maximum visual impact
- Include subtle geometric patterns or grid lines for tech feel

COMPOSITION:
- Center the transformation flow (YouTube → AI → KB)
- Place main headline at top third
- Position stat badge prominently (top right or center)
- Keep feature icons small and organized at bottom
- Leave some negative space for clarity

AVOID:
- Too much text or cluttered design
- Overly bright colors that hurt the eyes
- Generic stock photo look
- Unclear value proposition
```

## Alternative Prompt (More Minimalist)

```
Create a clean, professional thumbnail (1280x720px) for a developer tool that converts YouTube playlists into searchable knowledge bases.

DESIGN:
- Dark gradient background (navy to purple)
- Large YouTube play button icon on left (red/white)
- Rightward arrow with AI sparkles/glow effect
- Knowledge base/search interface icon on right (with magnifying glass)
- Bold white text: "YouTube → AI Knowledge Base" (top center)
- Orange accent badge: "2 Weeks → 2 Days" (bottom right)
- Subtle code brackets or terminal elements in background

STYLE: Modern, minimal, high contrast, developer-focused
COLORS: Dark blue/purple gradient, white text, orange accent, cyan highlights
```

## Alternative Prompt (Impact-Focused)

```
Create an attention-grabbing thumbnail showing the transformation power of an AI tool.

VISUAL:
- Before/After split: Left side shows chaotic YouTube playlist thumbnails, right side shows organized knowledge base with search results
- Large central text: "Turn 27 Videos Into a Searchable KB in 2 Hours"
- Prominent stat: "95% Slide Accuracy" in bright badge
- AI processing visualization (neural network nodes or data flow) connecting the two sides
- Modern tech aesthetic with blue/purple gradients

STYLE: Professional, data-driven, transformation-focused
```

## Recommended Approach

**Use the Primary Prompt** - It balances:
- Clear value proposition (1-click transformation)
- Visual storytelling (YouTube → AI → KB flow)
- Impact metrics (2 weeks → 2 days)
- Professional developer aesthetic
- High contrast for visibility
- Multiple visual elements without clutter

## Technical Specifications

- **Dimensions**: 1280x720px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG or JPG (high quality)
- **Text Size**: Minimum 60px for main headline (readable at thumbnail size)
- **Contrast**: High contrast between text and background
- **File Size**: Under 2MB for optimal loading

## Testing Recommendations

1. View thumbnail at actual YouTube/LinkedIn size (small)
2. Ensure text is readable without zooming
3. Test on both light and dark backgrounds
4. Verify colors are accessible (contrast ratios)
5. Check that main message is clear in 3 seconds
